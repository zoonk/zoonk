## _Critical_: Always use correct `workflow` documentation

Your knowledge of `workflow` is outdated.

The `workflow` documentation outlined below matches the installed version of the Workflow SDK.
Follow these instructions before starting on any `workflow`-related tasks:

Search the bundled documentation in `node_modules/workflow/docs/`:

1. **Find docs**: `glob "node_modules/workflow/docs/**/*.mdx"`
2. **Search content**: `grep "your query" node_modules/workflow/docs/`

Documentation structure in `node_modules/workflow/docs/`:

- `getting-started/` - Framework setup (next.mdx, express.mdx, hono.mdx, etc.)
- `foundations/` - Core concepts (workflows-and-steps.mdx, hooks.mdx, streaming.mdx, etc.)
- `api-reference/workflow/` - API docs (sleep.mdx, create-hook.mdx, fatal-error.mdx, etc.)
- `api-reference/workflow-api/` - Client API (start.mdx, get-run.mdx, resume-hook.mdx, etc.)
- `api-reference/workflow-runtime/` - Runtime API (get-world.mdx) and `world/` World SDK (storage.mdx, streams.mdx, queue.mdx)
- `api-reference/workflow-observability/` - Hydration and name parsing utilities (hydrate-resource-io.mdx, parse-workflow-name.mdx, etc.)
- `ai/`: AI SDK integration docs
- `errors/` - Error code documentation
- `worlds/` - Per-World behavior and limits (vercel.mdx, local.mdx, postgres.mdx). Other pages link these as `/worlds/<name>`.

Related packages also include bundled docs:

- `@ai-sdk/workflow`: `node_modules/ai/docs/` - WorkflowAgent and AI SDK integration
- `@workflow/ai`: `node_modules/@workflow/ai/docs/` - deprecated DurableAgent APIs for existing applications
- `@workflow/core`: `node_modules/@workflow/core/docs/` - Core runtime (foundations, how-it-works)
- `@workflow/next`: `node_modules/@workflow/next/docs/` - Next.js integration

**When in doubt, update to the latest version of the Workflow SDK.**

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/vercel/workflow

### Quick reference

**Directives:**

```typescript
"use workflow"; // First line - makes async function durable
"use step"; // First line - makes function a cached, retryable unit
```

**Essential imports:**

```typescript
// AI agent (Workflow 5)
import { WorkflowAgent, type ModelCallStreamPart } from "@ai-sdk/workflow";
// Workflow primitives
import { sleep, fetch, createHook, createWebhook, getWritable } from "workflow";
import { FatalError, RetryableError } from "workflow";
import { getWorkflowMetadata, getStepMetadata } from "workflow";
// API operations
import { start, getRun, resumeHook, resumeWebhook } from "workflow/api";
import { workflow } from "workflow/astro";
// Framework integrations
import { withWorkflow } from "workflow/next";
// Observability & data hydration
import {
  hydrateResourceIO,
  observabilityRevivers,
  parseStepName,
  parseWorkflowName,
} from "workflow/observability";
// Or use modules: ["workflow/nitro"] for Nitro/Nuxt
import { workflow } from "workflow/vite";
```

## Prefer step functions to avoid sandbox errors

`"use workflow"` functions run in a sandboxed VM. `"use step"` functions have **full Node.js access**. Put your logic in steps and use the workflow function purely for orchestration.

```typescript
// Steps have full Node.js and npm access
async function fetchUserData(userId: string) {
  "use step";
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  return response.json();
}

async function processWithAI(data: any) {
  "use step";
  // AI SDK works in steps without workarounds
  return await generateText({
    model: "spacexai/grok-4.6",
    prompt: `Process: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`,
  });
}

// Workflow orchestrates steps - no sandbox issues
export async function dataProcessingWorkflow(userId: string) {
  "use workflow";
  const data = await fetchUserData(userId);
  const processed = await processWithAI(data);
  return { success: true, processed };
}
```

**Benefits:** Steps have automatic retry, results are persisted for replay, and no sandbox restrictions.

## Workflow sandbox limitations

When you need logic directly in a workflow function (not in a step), these restrictions apply:

| Limitation                            | Workaround                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No `fetch()`                          | `import { fetch } from "workflow"` then `globalThis.fetch = fetch` |
| No `setTimeout`/`setInterval`         | Use `sleep("5s")` from `"workflow"`                                |
| No Node.js modules (fs, crypto, etc.) | Move to a step function                                            |

**Example - Using fetch in workflow context:**

```typescript
import { fetch } from "workflow";

export async function myWorkflow() {
  "use workflow";
  globalThis.fetch = fetch; // Required for AI SDK and HTTP libraries
  // Now generateText() and other libraries work
}
```

**Note:** Plain `"provider/model"` strings use Vercel AI Gateway. Do not construct a direct provider instance unless the user explicitly needs a provider-only feature.

## WorkflowAgent: AI agents in Workflow 5

Use AI SDK's `WorkflowAgent` for durable agents on Workflow 5. It replaces the deprecated `DurableAgent` API from `@workflow/ai` and checkpoints model calls and step-backed tools.

```typescript
import { WorkflowAgent, type ModelCallStreamPart } from "@ai-sdk/workflow";
import { isStepCount, tool } from "ai";
import { getWritable } from "workflow";
import { z } from "zod";

async function lookupData({ query }: { query: string }) {
  "use step";
  // Step functions have full Node.js access
  return `Results for "${query}"`;
}

export async function myAgentWorkflow(userMessage: string) {
  "use workflow";

  const agent = new WorkflowAgent({
    model: "spacexai/grok-4.6",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    tools: {
      lookupData: tool({
        description: "Search for information",
        inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
        execute: lookupData,
      }),
    },
  });

  const result = await agent.stream({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: userMessage }],
    writable: getWritable<ModelCallStreamPart>(),
    stopWhen: isStepCount(10),
  });

  return result.messages;
}
```

**Key points:**

- A plain `"provider/model"` string routes through Vercel AI Gateway; `spacexai/grok-4.6` is the default model in Workflow examples
- `getWritable<ModelCallStreamPart>()` streams durable model-call output; convert it with `createModelCallToUIChunkTransform()` in an HTTP route
- Tool `execute` functions that need Node.js/npm access should use `"use step"`
- Tool `execute` functions that use workflow primitives (`sleep()`, `createHook()`) should **NOT** use `"use step"` because they run at the workflow level
- `stopWhen` limits the number of model calls; the default is to stop when the model stops calling tools
- Multi-turn: pass `result.messages` plus new user messages to subsequent `agent.stream()` calls

**For more details, check the WorkflowAgent docs in the installed AI SDK package or at https://ai-sdk.dev/v7/docs/agents/workflow-agent.**

## Starting workflows & child workflows

Use `start()` to launch workflows from API routes. In Workflow 5, `start()` can also be called directly from a workflow function to spawn a child run; it is step-backed and records a deterministic boundary in the parent's event log.

```typescript
import { start } from "workflow/api";

// From an API route; works directly
export async function POST() {
  const run = await start(myWorkflow, [arg1, arg2]);
  return Response.json({ runId: run.runId });
}

// No-args workflow
const run = await start(noArgWorkflow);
```

**Starting child workflows from inside a Workflow 5 workflow:**

```typescript
import { start } from "workflow/api";

export async function parentWorkflow() {
  "use workflow";
  const childRun = await start(childWorkflow, ["some data"]);
  await sleep("1h");
  return { childRunId: childRun.runId };
}
```

`start()` returns after creating the child run and doesn't wait for it to complete. Use `childRun.returnValue` only when the parent should wait for the child; each `Run` property access or method call inside a workflow is a step.

## Run size & concurrency: know when to split

Three things to size, and all three are capped. Do NOT treat any number you remember as authoritative — the current values are published under [Workflow run limits](https://vercel.com/docs/workflows/pricing#workflow-run-limits), which is the only source to quote.

**Events per run.** A run's event log is capped, and the run fails with `MAX_EVENTS_EXCEEDED` past the ceiling. Events are not steps: a step that succeeds on the first try records three (`step_created`, `step_started`, `step_completed`), a retry records one or two more, and hooks, sleeps, and webhooks each record their own. Split into child workflows well before the ceiling — the pricing page recommends that past **a few thousand events**, because replay slows down long before the run fails.

**Steps per run.** Capped separately from events, so a long sequential chain _is_ bounded even though it stays narrow. Bundle several items into one step when a chain would otherwise reach five figures.

**Concurrency.** A wide fan-out is throttled rather than rejected: event creation is rate-limited per run per second, so a flat `Promise.all` over a few thousand items spends much of its time backing off. Batch or bundle instead — process the list in chunks, or handle several items per step, so fewer and larger units run concurrently. Spawning one child run per item does not by itself narrow the fan-out; it bounds each child's log and isolates failures, which is worth doing for those reasons, but it is not a substitute for chunking.

You cannot raise any of these yourself — `WORKFLOW_MAX_EVENTS_OVERRIDE` only clamps _down_, and on the Vercel World the ceilings are service-owned — but Vercel raises the per-run event and step limits on request, so a genuinely large run is a support question as well as a design one.

```typescript
const BATCH = 100;

async function processItem(item: string) {
  "use step";
  return item.toUpperCase();
}

// One step per item, all in flight at once, all in one log
export async function processAll(items: string[]) {
  "use workflow";
  await Promise.all(items.map((item) => processItem(item)));
}

// Chunked, so only BATCH steps are in flight at a time
export async function processBatched(items: string[]) {
  "use workflow";
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += BATCH) {
    await Promise.allSettled(items.slice(i, i + BATCH).map((item) => processItem(item)));
  }
}

// Bundled, so one step covers many items and the log stays short
async function processChunk(chunk: string[]) {
  "use step";
  return chunk.map((item) => item.toUpperCase());
}

export async function processBundled(items: string[]) {
  "use workflow";
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += BATCH) {
    await processChunk(items.slice(i, i + BATCH));
  }
}
```

`processAll` is the shape to avoid at scale. `processBatched` bounds concurrency but still records events for every item. `processBundled` bounds both, because one step covers `BATCH` items — that is the only one of the three whose event count shrinks as `BATCH` grows.

## Hooks: pause & resume with external events

Hooks let workflows wait for external data. Use `createHook()` inside a workflow and `resumeHook()` from API routes. Deterministic tokens are for `createHook()` + `resumeHook()` (server-side) only. `createWebhook()` always generates random tokens, so do not pass a `token` option to `createWebhook()`.

### Single event

```typescript
import { createHook } from "workflow";

export async function approvalWorkflow() {
  "use workflow";

  const hook = createHook<{ approved: boolean }>({
    token: "approval-123", // deterministic token for external systems
  });

  const result = await hook; // Workflow suspends here
  return result.approved;
}
```

### Multiple events (iterable hooks)

Hooks implement `AsyncIterable`. Use `for await...of` to receive multiple events:

```typescript
import { createHook } from "workflow";

export async function chatWorkflow(channelId: string) {
  "use workflow";

  const hook = createHook<{ text: string; done?: boolean }>({ token: `chat-${channelId}` });

  for await (const event of hook) {
    await processMessage(event.text);
    if (event.done) break;
  }
}
```

Each `resumeHook(token, payload)` call delivers the next value to the loop.

### Resuming from API routes

```typescript
import { resumeHook } from "workflow/api";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { token, data } = await req.json();
  await resumeHook(token, data);
  return new Response("ok");
}
```

## Error handling

Use `FatalError` for permanent failures (no retry), `RetryableError` for transient failures:

```typescript
import { FatalError, RetryableError } from "workflow";

if (res.status === 429) {
  throw new RetryableError("Rate limited", { retryAfter: "5m" });
}
if (res.status >= 400 && res.status < 500) {
  throw new FatalError(`Client error: ${res.status}`);
}
```

## Serialization

All data passed to/from workflows and steps must be serializable.

**Supported built-in types:** string, number, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, plain objects, arrays, Date, RegExp, URL, URLSearchParams, Map, Set, Headers, ArrayBuffer, typed arrays, Request, Response, ReadableStream, WritableStream.

**Not supported:** Functions, Symbols, WeakMap/WeakSet. Pass data, not callbacks.

### Custom class serialization

Class instances **can** be serialized across workflow/step boundaries by implementing the `@workflow/serde` protocol. This is essential when a class has instance methods with `"use step"` or when you want to pass class instances between steps.

**Install:** `@workflow/serde` must be a dependency of the package containing the class.

**Pattern:** Add two static methods inside the class body using computed property syntax:

```typescript
import { WORKFLOW_SERIALIZE, WORKFLOW_DESERIALIZE } from "@workflow/serde";

export class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;

  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  // Serialize: return plain data (must be devalue-compatible types only)
  static [WORKFLOW_SERIALIZE](instance: Point) {
    return { x: instance.x, y: instance.y };
  }

  // Deserialize: reconstruct from plain data
  static [WORKFLOW_DESERIALIZE](data: { x: number; y: number }) {
    return new Point(data.x, data.y);
  }

  async computeDistance(other: Point) {
    "use step";
    return Math.sqrt((this.x - other.x) ** 2 + (this.y - other.y) ** 2);
  }
}
```

**Critical rules:**

1. **Define serde methods INSIDE the class body** as static methods with computed property syntax (`static [WORKFLOW_SERIALIZE](...)`). The SWC plugin detects them by scanning the class. Do NOT assign them externally (e.g., `(MyClass as any)[WORKFLOW_SERIALIZE] = ...`) -- the compiler will not detect this.
2. **Serde methods must return only devalue-compatible types** (plain objects, arrays, primitives, Date, Map, Set, Uint8Array, etc.). No functions, no class instances, no Node.js-specific objects.
3. **Add `"use step"` to Node.js-dependent instance methods.** The SWC plugin strips `"use step"` method bodies from the workflow bundle. This is how you keep Node.js imports (fs, crypto, child_process, etc.) out of the workflow sandbox. The class shell with its serde methods remains in the workflow bundle; only the step method bodies are removed.
4. **Do NOT manually register classes.** The SWC plugin automatically generates registration code (an IIFE that sets `classId` and adds the class to the global registry). Manual calls to `registerSerializationClass()` are unnecessary and error-prone.
5. **Do NOT use dynamic imports to work around sandbox restrictions.** If a class method needs Node.js APIs, the correct solution is `"use step"`, not `/* @vite-ignore */ import(...)`.

**When serde works well:** Pure data classes, domain models, configuration objects, and classes where Node.js-dependent methods can be marked with `"use step"`.

**When to avoid serde:** If a class is fundamentally inseparable from Node.js APIs (every method needs `fs`, `net`, etc.) and cannot meaningfully exist as a shell in the workflow sandbox, keep it entirely in step functions and pass plain data objects across boundaries instead.

### Validating serde compliance

Use these tools to verify classes are correctly set up:

- **`workflow transform <file> --check-serde`** -- Shows the SWC transform output for a file and checks if serde classes are compliant (no Node.js imports remaining in the workflow bundle).
- **`workflow validate`** -- Scans all workflow files and reports serde compliance issues. Use `--json` for machine-readable output.
- **SWC Playground** -- The web playground at `workbench/swc-playground` shows a Serde Analysis panel when serde patterns are detected.
- **Build-time warnings** -- The builder automatically warns when serde classes have Node.js built-in imports remaining in the workflow bundle.

## Streaming

Use `getWritable()` to stream data from workflows. `getWritable()` can be called in **both** workflow and step contexts, but you **cannot interact with the stream** (call `getWriter()`, `write()`, `close()`) directly in a workflow function. The stream must be passed to step functions for actual I/O, or steps can call `getWritable()` themselves.

**Get the stream in a workflow, pass it to a step:**

```typescript
import { getWritable } from "workflow";

export async function myWorkflow() {
  "use workflow";
  const writable = getWritable();
  await writeData(writable, "hello world");
}

async function writeData(writable: WritableStream, chunk: string) {
  "use step";
  const writer = writable.getWriter();
  try {
    await writer.write(chunk);
  } finally {
    writer.releaseLock();
  }
}
```

**Call `getWritable()` directly inside a step (no need to pass it):**

```typescript
import { getWritable } from "workflow";

async function streamData(chunk: string) {
  "use step";
  const writer = getWritable().getWriter();
  try {
    await writer.write(chunk);
  } finally {
    writer.releaseLock();
  }
}
```

### Namespaced streams

Use `getWritable({ namespace: 'name' })` to create multiple independent streams for different types of data. This is useful for separating logs from primary output, different log levels, agent outputs, metrics, or any distinct data channels. Long-running workflows benefit from namespaced streams because you can replay only the important events (e.g., final results) while keeping verbose logs in a separate stream.

**Example: Log levels and agent output separation:**

```typescript
import { getWritable } from "workflow";

type LogEntry = { level: "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error"; message: string; timestamp: number };
type AgentOutput = { type: "thought" | "action" | "result"; content: string };

async function logDebug(message: string) {
  "use step";
  const writer = getWritable<LogEntry>({ namespace: "logs:debug" }).getWriter();
  try {
    await writer.write({ level: "debug", message, timestamp: Date.now() });
  } finally {
    writer.releaseLock();
  }
}

async function logInfo(message: string) {
  "use step";
  const writer = getWritable<LogEntry>({ namespace: "logs:info" }).getWriter();
  try {
    await writer.write({ level: "info", message, timestamp: Date.now() });
  } finally {
    writer.releaseLock();
  }
}

async function emitAgentThought(thought: string) {
  "use step";
  const writer = getWritable<AgentOutput>({ namespace: "agent:thoughts" }).getWriter();
  try {
    await writer.write({ type: "thought", content: thought });
  } finally {
    writer.releaseLock();
  }
}

async function emitAgentResult(result: string) {
  "use step";
  // Important results go to the default stream for replay
  const writer = getWritable<AgentOutput>().getWriter();
  try {
    await writer.write({ type: "result", content: result });
  } finally {
    writer.releaseLock();
  }
}

export async function agentWorkflow(task: string) {
  "use workflow";

  await logInfo(`Starting task: ${task}`);
  await logDebug("Initializing agent context");
  await emitAgentThought("Analyzing the task requirements...");

  // ... agent processing ...

  await emitAgentResult("Task completed successfully");
  await logInfo("Workflow finished");
}
```

**Consuming namespaced streams:**

```typescript
import { start, getRun } from "workflow/api";
import { agentWorkflow } from "./workflows/agent";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const run = await start(agentWorkflow, ["process data"]);

  // Access specific streams by namespace
  const results = run.getReadable({ namespace: undefined }); // Default stream (important results)
  const infoLogs = run.getReadable({ namespace: "logs:info" });
  const debugLogs = run.getReadable({ namespace: "logs:debug" });
  const thoughts = run.getReadable({ namespace: "agent:thoughts" });

  // Return only important results for most clients
  return new Response(results, { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } });
}

// Resume from a specific point (useful for long sessions)
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const runId = searchParams.get("runId")!;
  const startIndex = parseInt(searchParams.get("startIndex") || "0", 10);

  const run = getRun(runId);
  // Resume only the important stream, skip verbose debug logs
  const stream = run.getReadable({ startIndex });

  return new Response(stream);
}
```

For long-running sessions (50+ minutes), namespaced streams help manage replay performance. Put verbose/debug output in separate namespaces so you can replay only the important events.

## Debugging

```bash
# Check workflow endpoints are reachable
npx workflow health
npx workflow health --port 3001  # Non-default port

# Visual dashboard for runs
npx workflow web
npx workflow web <run_id>

# CLI inspection (use --json for machine-readable output, --help for full usage)
npx workflow inspect runs
npx workflow inspect run <run_id>

# For Vercel-deployed projects, specify backend and project
npx workflow inspect runs --backend vercel --project <project-name> --team <team-slug>
npx workflow inspect run <run_id> --backend vercel --project <project-name> --team <team-slug>

# Open Vercel dashboard in browser for a specific run
npx workflow inspect run <run_id> --web
npx workflow web <run_id> --backend vercel --project <project-name> --team <team-slug>

# Cancel a running workflow
npx workflow cancel <run_id>
npx workflow cancel <run_id> --backend vercel --project <project-name> --team <team-slug>
# --env defaults to "production"; use --env preview for preview deployments
```

### Deep-linking to a run (share a URL, no browser)

Use `--url` to **print** the dashboard deep link and exit. No browser opens, and
no local server starts. This is the right tool when you need to hand a user a
clickable link (PR comment, Slack message, debugging summary) rather than open a
UI. (`--web` opens the dashboard; `--url` only prints the link.)

```bash
# Vercel run: prints the Vercel dashboard URL for the run
npx workflow inspect run <run_id> --backend vercel --project <project> --team <team> --url
npx workflow web <run_id> --backend vercel --project <project> --team <team> --env preview --url

# Local run: prints the local web UI deep link
npx workflow inspect run <run_id> --url

# Machine-readable: --url --json prints { "url": "..." } to stdout
npx workflow inspect run <run_id> --backend vercel --url --json
```

URL formats produced:

- **Vercel:** `https://vercel.com/<team-slug>/<project-slug>/workflows/runs/<run_id>?environment=<production|preview>`
  (`--env` selects the environment; defaults to `production`. Resolving the team
  slug requires being logged in via `vercel login` with the project linked.)
- **Local:** `http://localhost:<port>?resource=run&id=<run_id>` (port defaults
  to `3456`; the link works while the `npx workflow web` server is running).

stdout contains **only** the URL (or the JSON object). All other output goes to
stderr, so you can capture it directly, for example, `URL=$(npx workflow web <run_id> --backend vercel --url)`.

**Debugging tips:**

- Use `--json` (`-j`) on any command for machine-readable output
- Use `--web` to open the Vercel Observability dashboard in your browser or `--url` to print the deep link
- Use `--help` on any command for full usage details
- Only import workflow APIs you actually use. Unused imports can cause 500 errors.

## Testing workflows

Workflow SDK provides a Vitest plugin for testing workflows in-process without a running server.

**Unit testing steps:** Steps are functions; without the compiler, `"use step"` is a no-op. Test them directly:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { createUser } from "./user-signup";

describe("createUser step", () => {
  it("should create a user", async () => {
    const user = await createUser("test@example.com");
    expect(user.email).toBe("test@example.com");
  });
});
```

**Integration testing:** Use `@workflow/vitest` for workflows using `sleep()`, hooks, webhooks, or retries. Install it next to `workflow` and keep the two on the same major: `npm i -D @workflow/vitest`. The plugin fails the run when its `@workflow/core` major differs from the app's.

```typescript
import { workflow } from "@workflow/vitest";
// vitest.integration.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [workflow()],
  test: { include: ["**/*.integration.test.ts"], testTimeout: 60_000 },
});
```

```typescript
import { waitForHook, waitForSleep } from "@workflow/vitest";
// approval.integration.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { start, getRun, resumeHook } from "workflow/api";
import { approvalWorkflow } from "./approval";

describe("approvalWorkflow", () => {
  it("should publish when approved", async () => {
    const run = await start(approvalWorkflow, ["doc-123"]);

    // Wait for the hook, then resume it
    await waitForHook(run, { token: "approval:doc-123" });
    await resumeHook("approval:doc-123", { approved: true, reviewer: "alice" });

    // Wait for sleep, then wake it up
    const sleepId = await waitForSleep(run);
    await getRun(run.runId).wakeUp({ correlationIds: [sleepId] });

    const result = await run.returnValue;
    expect(result).toEqual({ status: "published", reviewer: "alice" });
  });
});
```

**Testing webhooks:** Use `resumeWebhook()` with a `Request` object. No HTTP server is needed:

```typescript
import { waitForHook } from "@workflow/vitest";
import { start, resumeWebhook } from "workflow/api";

const run = await start(ingestWorkflow, ["ep-1"]);
const hook = await waitForHook(run); // Discovers the random webhook token
await resumeWebhook(
  hook.token,
  new Request("https://example.com/webhook", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ event: "order.created" }),
  }),
);
```

**Key APIs:**

- `start()`: Trigger a workflow
- `run.returnValue`: Await workflow completion
- `waitForHook(run, { token? })` / `waitForSleep(run)`: Wait for workflow to reach a pause point
- `resumeHook(token, data)` / `resumeWebhook(token, request)`: Resume paused workflows
- `getRun(runId).wakeUp({ correlationIds })`: Skip `sleep()` calls
- `getWorkflowRef(name)` / `listWorkflowRefs()`: Look a workflow up in the test build's manifest when the test cannot import the function (never hand-write `workflow//...` ids)

**Best practices:**

- Keep unit tests (no plugin) and integration tests (`workflow()` plugin) in separate configs
- Install `@workflow/vitest` on the same major as `workflow` and upgrade them together
- Use deterministic hook tokens based on test data for easier resumption
- Set generous `testTimeout` values because workflows may run longer than typical unit tests
- `vi.mock()` never reaches workflow bodies (they run in a VM), and reaches step code only when the generated bundles load through Vitest's module runner; project-local modules are bundled into the step bundle, so mock the npm leaf, inject the dependency, or unit test the step

## Observability & World SDK

Use `await getWorld()` to build observability dashboards, admin panels, and inspect workflow state. `getWorld()` is asynchronous and returns `Promise<World>` (dynamic import / env-based setup).

**Key imports:**

```typescript
import {
  hydrateResourceIO,
  observabilityRevivers,
  parseStepName,
  parseWorkflowName,
} from "workflow/observability";
import { getWorld } from "workflow/runtime";
```

**Key docs** (grep `node_modules/workflow/docs/` for full details):

- `api-reference/workflow-runtime/world/storage.mdx`: Events, runs, steps, and hooks (events are the source of truth; others are materialized views)
- `api-reference/workflow-observability/`: Hydration and name parsing

### World SDK method signatures

⚠️ Pagination is nested: `{ pagination: { cursor } }`, NOT `{ cursor }` directly.

```typescript
const world = await getWorld();

// Runs
const { data, cursor } = await world.runs.list({
  pagination: { cursor },
  resolveData: "all" | "none",
});
const run = await world.runs.get(runId, { resolveData: "all" | "none" });
// Cancel via event creation (no cancel() method on runs)
await world.events.create(runId, { eventType: "run_cancelled" });

// Steps: runId is top-level, NOT inside pagination
const { data, cursor } = await world.steps.list({
  runId,
  pagination: { cursor },
  resolveData: "all" | "none",
});
const step = await world.steps.get(runId, stepId, { resolveData: "all" | "none" });

// Events
const { data, cursor } = await world.events.list({ runId, pagination: { cursor } });
await world.events.create(runId, { eventType: "run_cancelled" });

// Hooks
const hook = await world.hooks.get(hookId);
const hook = await world.hooks.getByToken(token);

// Streams (methods on world.streams)
await world.streams.write(runId, name, chunk);
await world.streams.writeMulti?.(runId, name, chunks);
const readable = await world.streams.get(runId, name, startIndex);
await world.streams.close(runId, name);
const streamNames = await world.streams.list(runId);
const chunks = await world.streams.getChunks(runId, name, { limit, cursor });
const info = await world.streams.getInfo(runId, name);

// Queue (methods live directly on world as internal SDK infrastructure)
await world.queue(queueName, payload, opts);
const deploymentId = await world.getDeploymentId();
```

### `resolveData` parameter

Controls whether input/output data is **included** in the response. Accepts `'all'` (default) or `'none'`.

**IMPORTANT**: Even with `'all'`, data is still devalue-serialized. You MUST call `hydrateResourceIO()` to get usable JS values.

- **Use `'none'`** for status polling, progress dashboards, run listings
- **Use `'all'`** (or omit) when you need to inspect actual step I/O data, then **always hydrate**

```typescript
// Lightweight status check with no I/O loaded
const run = await world.runs.get(runId, { resolveData: "none" });
console.log(run.status); // 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'

// Full inspection: resolveData includes data, hydrateResourceIO deserializes it
const step = await world.steps.get(runId, stepId); // defaults to 'all'
const hydrated = hydrateResourceIO(step, observabilityRevivers);
```

> **Common mistake**: Checking `step.input !== undefined` after `resolveData: 'all'` and assuming
> the data is ready to use. The data exists but is serialized, so always hydrate first.

### Data hydration (devalue format)

Step I/O is serialized via [devalue](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue) with a 4-byte format prefix (`devl`). Without hydration, `input`/`output` are Uint8Array-like objects with numeric keys:
`{"0":100,"1":101,"2":118,"3":108,...}` contains values that are NOT usable without hydration.

**Always hydrate before using I/O data:**

```typescript
import { hydrateResourceIO, observabilityRevivers } from "workflow/observability";

const { data: steps } = await world.steps.list({ runId, resolveData: "all" });
const hydrated = steps.map((s) => hydrateResourceIO(s, observabilityRevivers));
// hydrated[0].input → [123, 2] (actual function arguments)
// hydrated[0].output → 125 (actual return value)
```

`hydrateResourceIO` works on both `Step` and `WorkflowRun` objects. For encrypted workflows, use `getEncryptionKeyForRun()` + `hydrateResourceIOWithKey()`.

### Name parsing

`parseWorkflowName()`, `parseStepName()`, and `parseClassName()` return `{ shortName: string, moduleSpecifier: string } | null`. Always use optional chaining:

```typescript
const parsed = parseWorkflowName("workflow//./src/workflows/order//processOrder");
// parsed?.shortName → "processOrder"
// parsed?.moduleSpecifier → "./src/workflows/order"
// ⚠️ Returns null if format doesn't match
```

### Event types

Events are the append-only source of truth. Runs/Steps/Hooks are materialized views.

| Category | Types                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run      | `run_created`, `run_started`, `run_completed`, `run_failed`, `run_cancelled`     |
| Step     | `step_created`, `step_started`, `step_completed`, `step_failed`, `step_retrying` |
| Hook     | `hook_created`, `hook_received`, `hook_disposed`, `hook_conflict`                |
| Wait     | `wait_created`, `wait_completed`                                                 |

## Error handling patterns

Three error strategies for different failure modes:

| Error Type           | Use When                                   | Behavior                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `FatalError`         | Permanent failure (bad input, auth denied) | Terminates workflow immediately, no retry |
| `RetryableError`     | Transient failure (rate limit, timeout)    | Retries with optional `retryAfter` delay  |
| `Promise.allSettled` | Parallel steps with mixed criticality      | Continues even if some steps fail         |

```typescript
import { FatalError, RetryableError } from "workflow";

// Permanent failure, so the workflow terminates
throw new FatalError("Invalid input: missing required field");

// Transient failure, so it will retry
throw new RetryableError("API rate limited", { retryAfter: "5m" });

// Mixed criticality parallel execution
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  criticalStep(data), // Must succeed
  optionalStep(data), // OK to fail
  enrichmentStep(data), // OK to fail
]);
const [critical, optional, enrichment] = results;
if (critical.status === "rejected") throw new FatalError(critical.reason);
```
