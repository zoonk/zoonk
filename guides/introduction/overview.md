## Directory structure

- `.github`: Continuous integration workflows, Copilot instructions, and anything else related to GitHub.
- `assets`: CSS and JavaScript files/libraries.
- `config`: Configuration files for `dev`, `test`, `runtime`, and `prod` environments.
- `lib`: The main application code, including both the web interface and business logic.
  - `zoonk`: Business logic and domain models.
    - `_checks`: Custom checks for Credo.
    - `_queries`: Queries for each model, organized here for composability and making explicit what they do/what business logic they implement/what our intent is.
    - `_schema`: Ecto schemas for each model.
    - Phoenix contexts for our application. Each context is a module that encapsulates a behavior. Think of them as events that trigger commands. For example, `Zoonk.Auth` is the context for authentication; `Zoonk.Auth.TokenBuilder` is a sub-context for building auth tokens; while `Zoonk.Auth.UserNotifier` is a sub-context for sending auth-related emails to users.
  - `zoonk_web`: Web interface, including controllers, views, and templates. It includes both the API and the frontend.
    - `components`: LiveView (see `Phoenix.LiveComponent`) and function components (see `Phoenix.Component`) to be used in the UI.
    - `controllers`: Controllers for the API and the web interface.
    - `layouts`: Layouts for the web interface.
    - `live`: Frontend pages using `Phoenix.LiveView`.
    - `router.ex`: The router for the web interface.
- `priv`: Static files, migrations, seeds, and translations.
- `test`: Tests for the application.
