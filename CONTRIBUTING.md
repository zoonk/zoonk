# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! The project is still in its early stages, so we’re not ready to accept contributions yet as we’re still setting things up. However, we’d love to hear your feedback and ideas—feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions/new/choose).

## Translations

At the moment, we support only these languages:

- US English (en)
- Brazilian Portuguese (pt)
- Spanish (es)

For commercial reasons, we’re not accepting new translations right now.
