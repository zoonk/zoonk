# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! The project is still in its early stages, so we’re not ready to accept contributions yet as we’re still setting things up. However, we’d love to hear your feedback and ideas—feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions/new/choose).

## Translations

At the moment, we support only these languages:

- US English (en)
- Brazilian Portuguese (pt)
- Spanish (es)

For commercial reasons, we’re not accepting new translations right now.

## Commit Messages

Add one of the following prefixes to your commit messages:

- `feat:` a new feature
- `fix:` a bug fix
- `chore:` changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `refactor:` code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test:` adding or updating tests
- `deps:` updating dependencies

If applicable, include the app or package name in parentheses after the prefix. For example:

- `feat(auth): add login functionality`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
