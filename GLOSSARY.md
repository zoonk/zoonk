- **Chapter**: Chapters are a group of lessons that cover a specific topic within a course.
- **Lesson**: Lessons are very small units of knowledge. They cover only a single topic for better understanding and they have a fixed set of exercises:

  - **Background**: Explains the problem that led to a topic’s creation, what came before it, and why it matters. The “why” of a concept.
  - **Explanation**: Covers the key theoretical concepts so the topic is clearly understood. The “what” of a concept.
  - **Mechanics**: Breaks down the processes or systems that make the topic work under the hood. The “how” of a concept.
  - **Examples**: Shows practical, real-world uses or appearances of the topic. The “where” of a concept.
  - **Connections**: Relates the topic to the learner’s personal interests and daily life using AI.
  - **Story**: Puts the learner in an interactive story to experience practical situations tied to the topic.
  - **Logic**: Challenges the learner to use reasoning and critical thinking to solve a problem.
  - **Simulation**: Lets learners manipulate variables to see how actions change a system’s state over time.
  - **Challenge**: Presents complex, decision-based problems where choices affect resources and outcomes.

Most static exercises also have an interactive counterpart to enhance understanding. It works like a quiz where learners can test their knowledge and receive immediate feedback.
