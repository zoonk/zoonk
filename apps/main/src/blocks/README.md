# Blocks

We're following the [components.build](https://www.components.build/definitions#14-block) definition for building our blocks:

> A block is an opinionated, production-ready composition of components that solves a concrete interface use case (often product-specific) with content scaffolding. Blocks trade generality for speed of adoption.
>
> Examples: Pricing table, auth screens, onboarding stepper, AI chat panel, billing settings form.

These blocks use the reusable components and patterns from [@zoonk/ui](../../../../packages/ui/README.md).
