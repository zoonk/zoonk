For example: 'Portfolio Structure' covers three distinct sections (projects, about, contact) in its description. 'Technical Writing Basics' is a broad topic that should be broken down into more specific skills. 'Talk Preparation Steps' combines content planning and timing. 'Social Media for Branding' covers two platforms (Twitter and LinkedIn) and two activities (sharing updates and networking), which should have been split into multiple, more focused lessons.",

Similarly, 'Technical Writing Basics' could be broken down into 'Achieving Clarity in Writing' and 'Choosing the Right Level of Detail'. This would make the lesson list truly conform to the 'explainable in 10 tweets' rule for every single item.",
