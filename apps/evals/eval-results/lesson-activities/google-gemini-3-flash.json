Listing \"Cook the Spaghetti\" (Activity 2) fully before \"Sauté the Guanciale\" (Activity 3) implies completing the pasta cooking (including draining) before starting the meat. Since rendering guanciale takes 10-15 minutes, the pasta would cool down and clump, failing to provide the heat necessary to cook the egg mixture in the final step. A logical progression would be to sauté the guanciale first (or parallel to water boiling) so the hot pasta can go immediately into the mix.",
