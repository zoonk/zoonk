The lesson description explicitly mentions multiple distinct phases.\n\n      Each activity should represent a substantial phase. Complex tasks naturally require more activities than simple ones.\n\n      \n  EVALUATION CRITERIA (focus on these, not specific phase names):\n\n  1. ACTIVITY SIZING: Each activity must be substantial enough to expand into ~10 detailed steps. If an activity could only be explained in 1-3 steps, it's TOO SMALL.\n\n  2. NO SINGLE ACTIONS: Activities must NOT be single actions like \"boil water\", \"click button\", \"hold item\". These are steps, not activities.\n\n  3. LOGICAL GROUPING: Related actions should be grouped into meaningful phases rather than listed separately.\n\n  4. COMPLETENESS: Activities should cover the full scope of the lesson - check if anything important is missing.\n\n  5. APPROPRIATE SCOPE: Content should match the lesson's scope - not broader, not narrower.\n\n  6. CLEAR TITLES: Titles should be short and action-oriented. No vague words like \"learn about\", \"understand\", \"explore\".\n\n  7. NO FLUFF: No summary, review, or assessment activities.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT penalize for missing specific phases you might expect. Different valid approaches exist.
