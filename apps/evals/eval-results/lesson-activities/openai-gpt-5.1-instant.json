The lesson topic (Carbonara) is a relatively short and simple process, yet it has been broken down into 7 separate activities. Several of these, specifically 'Make the Egg and Cheese Mixture' and 'Plate and Serve the Carbonara', are too small to be expanded into ~10 detailed steps without excessive padding or fluff. For instance, making the egg mixture primarily consists of cracking eggs, grating cheese, and whisking (3-4 steps max), which directly violates the instruction: 'If NO (only 1-3 steps possible) -> It's too small'.",
