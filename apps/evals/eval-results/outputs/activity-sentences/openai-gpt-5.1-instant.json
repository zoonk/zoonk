Apply the same rules as the sentence field.\n\n4. **Vocabulary coverage**: Ensure the provided vocabulary words are naturally distributed across the sentences. Each vocabulary word should appear in at least one sentence.\n\n5. **Balanced difficulty**: Include a mix of simpler and more complex sentences to accommodate different learning stages.\n",
