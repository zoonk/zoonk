For example:\n  - Topics: \"World War II\", \"Quantum Mechanics\", \"States of Matter\"\n  - Books: \"1984\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"The Great Gatsby\"\n  - Series: \"Harry Potter\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"Game of Thrones\"\n- For books/movies/IP, use the **official** name (e.g., \"The Great Gatsby\", not \"Great Gatsby\" or \"Gatsby\")\n  - This doesn't apply to general topics (e.g., \"General Relativity\" is correct, we wouldn't say \"The General Relativity Theory\")\n- Fixes any typos (e.g. \"Rolling Stones\" instead of \"roling stone\")\n- You should add other related suggestions to this subject\n\n#### Abbreviations\n\n- Avoid abbreviations in titles unless the abbreviated form is universally recognized. For example:\n  - Use \"Machine Learning\" instead of \"ML\" and \"Computer Science\" instead of \"CS\"\n  - However, words like DNA, GDP, NASA, UK, EU, SAT, HTML, SQL, etc. are more often used in their abbreviated forms and are acceptable\n- Think of this:\n  - People will never say \"HyperText Markup Language\", they will say \"HTML\"\n  - However, even though \"NLP\" is widely used, people will more often say \"Natural Language Processing\" when naming a course\n",
