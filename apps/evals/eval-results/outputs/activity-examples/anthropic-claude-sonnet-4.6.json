A context-focused headline that signals WHERE.\n- **text**: Maximum 300 characters. A conversational paragraph that places the learner IN that situation.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if chatting with a curious friend about where they'll encounter this\n- **Rich in everyday metaphors**: Use analogies from familiar activities (cooking, sports, games, music, travel) to make connections vivid\n- **Recognition-focused**: Help learners have \"aha moments\" — \"I never realized that was [topic]!\"\n- **Varied contexts**: Mix obvious and unexpected applications to spark curiosity\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Process explanations (that's Mechanics' job — HOW it works)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job — WHY it exists)\n- Abstract or theoretical applications without concrete situations\n- Only work/academic examples — include daily life, hobbies, pop culture\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"Variables in Programming\", show diverse uses, not just \"counter variables\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n- **Mechanics**: HOW it works (processes in action, cause-effect chains)\n\nYour Examples activity shows WHERE (real-world contexts, applications, everyday situations). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n- Examples: \"WHERE will I encounter this in my life?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation or processes from Mechanics. Assume the learner knows what it IS and how it WORKS, and is now ready to see where it APPEARS.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Examples activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Familiar Encounter**: A daily-life situation where this appears\n2. **The Work Context**: A professional or career-related scenario\n3. **The Pop Culture Moment**: Where this shows up in entertainment, media, or sports\n4. **The Unexpected Find**: A surprising or creative place it appears\n5. **The Personal Connection**: How it relates to hobbies, relationships, or self-improvement\n6. **The Expert View**: How professionals in the field encounter this regularly\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the topic's presence in real life dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Variables in Programming\n\nHere's how an Examples activity might flow for \"Variables in Programming\" (assuming learners already know WHAT variables are and HOW they store values):\n\n| Title                 | Text                                                                                                                                                               |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Your Shopping Cart    | Every time you add something to an online cart, a variable keeps track of your running total. Add a $15 book, the variable updates. Remove it, it adjusts again.   |\n| Video Game Lives      | That \"Lives: 3\" on your screen? A variable. Grab a power-up and it becomes 4. Hit a hazard and it drops to 2. The game constantly reads and updates this number.   |\n| The Thermostat        | Your smart thermostat stores the current temperature in a variable and compares it to your desired setting. When they don't match, it kicks on heating or cooling. |\n| Social Media Counters | Followers, likes, unread notifications — each is a variable being updated every second as people interact with your content around the world.                      |\n| Your Music Playlist   | Shuffle mode uses a variable to track which song is currently playing. Skip forward and the variable points to the next track.                                     |\n| Recipe Scaling        | When a recipe app asks for servings and adjusts quantities, it's multiplying ingredient amounts stored in variables by your desired number.                        |\n\nNotice how each step PLACES the learner in a familiar situation, showing where variables quietly work behind the scenes. The learner can now spot variables everywhere in their daily life. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the topic you're illustrating. It could be more or fewer steps depending on how many meaningful contexts exist.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step place the learner in a recognizable real-world situation?\n- [ ] Are contexts diverse (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected, personal)?\n- [ ] Does the learner get \"aha moments\" — recognizing the topic in familiar places?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with EXPLANATION_STEPS content (definitions) or Mechanics (processes)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on WHERE (contexts) not WHAT (definitions) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are both obvious and unexpected applications included?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Context-focused headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, situation-placing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the topic across meaningful real-world contexts. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the topic's presence in everyday life dictate the length.\n",

What Is Probability?: Probability measures how likely something is to happen, expressed as a number between 0 and 1. Zero means impossible, one means certain, and values in between show varying degrees of likelihood.\n2. Sample Space: The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes. For a coin flip, it's heads or tails. For a die roll, it's 1 through 6. Knowing the sample space is the first step in calculating probabilities.\n3. Calculating Probability: To find the probability of an event, divide favorable outcomes by total possible outcomes. If 2 out of 6 die faces are even, the probability of rolling an even number is 2/6 or about 33%."

A conversational paragraph that places the learner IN that situation.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if chatting with a curious friend about where they'll encounter this\n- **Rich in everyday metaphors**: Use analogies from familiar activities (cooking, sports, games, music, travel) to make connections vivid\n- **Recognition-focused**: Help learners have \"aha moments\" — \"I never realized that was [topic]!\"\n- **Varied contexts**: Mix obvious and unexpected applications to spark curiosity\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Process explanations (that's Mechanics' job — HOW it works)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job — WHY it exists)\n- Abstract or theoretical applications without concrete situations\n- Only work/academic examples — include daily life, hobbies, pop culture\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"Variables in Programming\", show diverse uses, not just \"counter variables\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n- **Mechanics**: HOW it works (processes in action, cause-effect chains)\n\nYour Examples activity shows WHERE (real-world contexts, applications, everyday situations). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n- Examples: \"WHERE will I encounter this in my life?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation or processes from Mechanics. Assume the learner knows what it IS and how it WORKS, and is now ready to see where it APPEARS.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Examples activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Familiar Encounter**: A daily-life situation where this appears\n2. **The Work Context**: A professional or career-related scenario\n3. **The Pop Culture Moment**: Where this shows up in entertainment, media, or sports\n4. **The Unexpected Find**: A surprising or creative place it appears\n5. **The Personal Connection**: How it relates to hobbies, relationships, or self-improvement\n6. **The Expert View**: How professionals in the field encounter this regularly\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the topic's presence in real life dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Variables in Programming\n\nHere's how an Examples activity might flow for \"Variables in Programming\" (assuming learners already know WHAT variables are and HOW they store values):\n\n| Title                 | Text                                                                                                                                                               |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Your Shopping Cart    | Every time you add something to an online cart, a variable keeps track of your running total. Add a $15 book, the variable updates. Remove it, it adjusts again.   |\n| Video Game Lives      | That \"Lives: 3\" on your screen? A variable. Grab a power-up and it becomes 4. Hit a hazard and it drops to 2. The game constantly reads and updates this number.   |\n| The Thermostat        | Your smart thermostat stores the current temperature in a variable and compares it to your desired setting. When they don't match, it kicks on heating or cooling. |\n| Social Media Counters | Followers, likes, unread notifications — each is a variable being updated every second as people interact with your content around the world.                      |\n| Your Music Playlist   | Shuffle mode uses a variable to track which song is currently playing. Skip forward and the variable points to the next track.                                     |\n| Recipe Scaling        | When a recipe app asks for servings and adjusts quantities, it's multiplying ingredient amounts stored in variables by your desired number.                        |\n\nNotice how each step PLACES the learner in a familiar situation, showing where variables quietly work behind the scenes. The learner can now spot variables everywhere in their daily life. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the topic you're illustrating. It could be more or fewer steps depending on how many meaningful contexts exist.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step place the learner in a recognizable real-world situation?\n- [ ] Are contexts diverse (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected, personal)?\n- [ ] Does the learner get \"aha moments\" — recognizing the topic in familiar places?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with EXPLANATION_STEPS content (definitions) or Mechanics (processes)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on WHERE (contexts) not WHAT (definitions) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are both obvious and unexpected applications included?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Context-focused headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, situation-placing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the topic across meaningful real-world contexts. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the topic's presence in everyday life dictate the length.\n",

Interest on Interest: Compound interest is earning interest on your interest. Unlike simple interest that only grows the original amount, compound interest grows the total including previous interest earned.\n2. Compounding Frequency: The compounding period determines how often interest is calculated. Monthly compounding adds interest 12 times per year; daily compounding adds it 365 times. More frequent = faster growth.\n3. The Rule of 72: The Rule of 72 estimates doubling time: divide 72 by the interest rate. At 8% annual return, money doubles roughly every 9 years.

Think of it like being a tour guide who points out hidden patterns in places people already visit.\n\n## Why Real-World Context Works\n\n1. **Recognition**: When learners see a topic in familiar contexts, they think \"Oh, THAT'S what that is!\" — moving from abstract to concrete.\n\n2. **Relevance**: Connecting to daily life answers the eternal question: \"When will I ever use this?\"\n\n3. **Transfer**: Seeing multiple contexts helps learners apply knowledge beyond the original learning environment.\n\n## The Context Diversity Principle\n\nEvery great Examples activity shows the topic across varied life domains:\n\n- **Daily life**: Household, shopping, commuting, routine activities\n- **Work & career**: Professional contexts, business scenarios, job skills\n- **Pop culture & media**: Movies, games, music, social media, sports\n- **Creative & unexpected**: Surprising places the topic appears\n- **Personal growth & hobbies**: Self-improvement, relationships, interests\n\nNot every topic needs all domains, but variety helps different learners connect.\n\n## Why Short Steps Work\n\nEach step should be a \"spotlight\" on one context — brief enough to recognize instantly, substantial enough to create an \"aha moment.\" Short steps:\n\n- Let learners focus on one familiar situation at a time\n- Build a mental map of where this topic lives in their world\n- Create multiple connection points for memory\n- Allow learners to identify with at least some contexts\n\n# Inputs\n\n- `LESSON_TITLE`: The topic to show examples of\n- `LESSON_DESCRIPTION`: Additional context about what this lesson covers\n- `CHAPTER_TITLE`: The chapter context (for understanding scope)\n- `COURSE_TITLE`: The course context (for understanding audience level)\n- `LANGUAGE`: Output language\n- `EXPLANATION_STEPS`: Array of {title, text} from the Explanation activity learners completed before this one (to avoid repeating content)\n\n## Language Guidelines\n\n- `en`: Use US English unless the content is region-specific\n- `pt`: Use Brazilian Portuguese unless the content is region-specific\n- `es`: Use Latin American Spanish unless the content is region-specific\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Step Structure\n\nEach step must have:\n\n- **title**: Maximum 50 characters. A context-focused headline that signals WHERE.\n- **text**: Maximum 300 characters. A conversational paragraph that places the learner IN that situation.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if chatting with a curious friend about where they'll encounter this\n- **Rich in everyday metaphors**: Use analogies from familiar activities (cooking, sports, games, music, travel) to make connections vivid\n- **Recognition-focused**: Help learners have \"aha moments\" — \"I never realized that was [topic]!\"\n- **Varied contexts**: Mix obvious and unexpected applications to spark curiosity\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Process explanations (that's Mechanics' job — HOW it works)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job — WHY it exists)\n- Abstract or theoretical applications without concrete situations\n- Only work/academic examples — include daily life, hobbies, pop culture\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"Variables in Programming\", show diverse uses, not just \"counter variables\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n- **Mechanics**: HOW it works (processes in action, cause-effect chains)\n\nYour Examples activity shows WHERE (real-world contexts, applications, everyday situations). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n- Examples: \"WHERE will I encounter this in my life?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation or processes from Mechanics. Assume the learner knows what it IS and how it WORKS, and is now ready to see where it APPEARS.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Examples activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Familiar Encounter**: A daily-life situation where this appears\n2. **The Work Context**: A professional or career-related scenario\n3. **The Pop Culture Moment**: Where this shows up in entertainment, media, or sports\n4. **The Unexpected Find**: A surprising or creative place it appears\n5. **The Personal Connection**: How it relates to hobbies, relationships, or self-improvement\n6. **The Expert View**: How professionals in the field encounter this regularly\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the topic's presence in real life dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Variables in Programming\n\nHere's how an Examples activity might flow for \"Variables in Programming\" (assuming learners already know WHAT variables are and HOW they store values):\n\n| Title                 | Text                                                                                                                                                               |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Your Shopping Cart    | Every time you add something to an online cart, a variable keeps track of your running total. Add a $15 book, the variable updates. Remove it, it adjusts again.   |\n| Video Game Lives      | That \"Lives: 3\" on your screen? A variable. Grab a power-up and it becomes 4. Hit a hazard and it drops to 2. The game constantly reads and updates this number.   |\n| The Thermostat        | Your smart thermostat stores the current temperature in a variable and compares it to your desired setting. When they don't match, it kicks on heating or cooling. |\n| Social Media Counters | Followers, likes, unread notifications — each is a variable being updated every second as people interact with your content around the world.                      |\n| Your Music Playlist   | Shuffle mode uses a variable to track which song is currently playing. Skip forward and the variable points to the next track.                                     |\n| Recipe Scaling        | When a recipe app asks for servings and adjusts quantities, it's multiplying ingredient amounts stored in variables by your desired number.                        |\n\nNotice how each step PLACES the learner in a familiar situation, showing where variables quietly work behind the scenes. The learner can now spot variables everywhere in their daily life. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the topic you're illustrating. It could be more or fewer steps depending on how many meaningful contexts exist.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step place the learner in a recognizable real-world situation?\n- [ ] Are contexts diverse (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected, personal)?\n- [ ] Does the learner get \"aha moments\" — recognizing the topic in familiar places?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with EXPLANATION_STEPS content (definitions) or Mechanics (processes)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on WHERE (contexts) not WHAT (definitions) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are both obvious and unexpected applications included?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Context-focused headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, situation-placing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the topic across meaningful real-world contexts. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the topic's presence in everyday life dictate the length.\n",

Assume the learner knows what it IS and how it WORKS, and is now ready to see where it APPEARS.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Examples activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Familiar Encounter**: A daily-life situation where this appears\n2. **The Work Context**: A professional or career-related scenario\n3. **The Pop Culture Moment**: Where this shows up in entertainment, media, or sports\n4. **The Unexpected Find**: A surprising or creative place it appears\n5. **The Personal Connection**: How it relates to hobbies, relationships, or self-improvement\n6. **The Expert View**: How professionals in the field encounter this regularly\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the topic's presence in real life dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Variables in Programming\n\nHere's how an Examples activity might flow for \"Variables in Programming\" (assuming learners already know WHAT variables are and HOW they store values):\n\n| Title                 | Text                                                                                                                                                               |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Your Shopping Cart    | Every time you add something to an online cart, a variable keeps track of your running total. Add a $15 book, the variable updates. Remove it, it adjusts again.   |\n| Video Game Lives      | That \"Lives: 3\" on your screen? A variable. Grab a power-up and it becomes 4. Hit a hazard and it drops to 2. The game constantly reads and updates this number.   |\n| The Thermostat        | Your smart thermostat stores the current temperature in a variable and compares it to your desired setting. When they don't match, it kicks on heating or cooling. |\n| Social Media Counters | Followers, likes, unread notifications — each is a variable being updated every second as people interact with your content around the world.                      |\n| Your Music Playlist   | Shuffle mode uses a variable to track which song is currently playing. Skip forward and the variable points to the next track.                                     |\n| Recipe Scaling        | When a recipe app asks for servings and adjusts quantities, it's multiplying ingredient amounts stored in variables by your desired number.                        |\n\nNotice how each step PLACES the learner in a familiar situation, showing where variables quietly work behind the scenes. The learner can now spot variables everywhere in their daily life. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the topic you're illustrating. It could be more or fewer steps depending on how many meaningful contexts exist.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step place the learner in a recognizable real-world situation?\n- [ ] Are contexts diverse (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected, personal)?\n- [ ] Does the learner get \"aha moments\" — recognizing the topic in familiar places?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with EXPLANATION_STEPS content (definitions) or Mechanics (processes)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on WHERE (contexts) not WHAT (definitions) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are both obvious and unexpected applications included?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Context-focused headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, situation-placing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the topic across meaningful real-world contexts. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the topic's presence in everyday life dictate the length.\n",

Circular Causation: A feedback loop occurs when a system's output circles back to influence its input. The result of an action affects the conditions that produced it, creating a cycle.\n2. Negative Feedback: Negative feedback stabilizes systems by counteracting change. When temperature rises, a thermostat activates cooling. The response opposes the initial change.\n3. Positive Feedback: Positive feedback amplifies change. A microphone near a speaker creates a growing screech — sound feeds back and gets louder. Positive feedback often leads to rapid escalation."

It could be more or fewer steps depending on how many meaningful contexts exist.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step place the learner in a recognizable real-world situation?\n- [ ] Are contexts diverse (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected, personal)?\n- [ ] Does the learner get \"aha moments\" — recognizing the topic in familiar places?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with EXPLANATION_STEPS content (definitions) or Mechanics (processes)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on WHERE (contexts) not WHAT (definitions) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are both obvious and unexpected applications included?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Context-focused headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, situation-placing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the topic across meaningful real-world contexts. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the topic's presence in everyday life dictate the length.\n",

O Papel da Dopamina: A dopamina e um neurotransmissor envolvido em recompensa e motivacao. Ela nao apenas sinaliza prazer — ela antecipa recompensas e nos motiva a busca-las.\n2. Aprendizado por Recompensa: O sistema de recompensa do cerebro usa dopamina para reforcar comportamentos. Quando algo e melhor do que esperado, ha um pico de dopamina que fortalece a conexao.\n3. Adaptacao e Tolerancia: A tolerancia ocorre quando o cerebro se adapta a estimulos frequentes. O mesmo estimulo produz menos dopamina com o tempo, exigindo mais para o mesmo efeito."
