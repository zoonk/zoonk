Think of it like being a sports commentator who helps viewers see the play unfold in real-time, calling out each action and its effect.\n\n## Why Process Visualization Works\n\n1. **Mental Simulation**: When learners can \"run the process\" in their minds, they truly understand it — not just memorize steps.\n\n2. **Cause-Effect Clarity**: Seeing what triggers what reveals the logic behind systems. Understanding causes makes effects predictable.\n\n3. **Debugging Intuition**: When you know how something flows, you can spot where things might break or go wrong.\n\n## The Process Flow Principle\n\nEvery great Mechanics activity follows an action-driven arc:\n\n- **Trigger**: What kicks things off? What sets the process in motion?\n- **Flow**: What happens next? How does one step lead to another?\n- **Interactions**: How do parts affect each other? What depends on what?\n- **Outcome**: What's the end result? How do you know the process completed?\n\n## Why Short Steps Work\n\nEach step should be a \"frame\" in your mental movie — brief enough to visualize clearly, substantial enough to show real action. Short steps:\n\n- Let learners see one action at a time\n- Build a complete mental simulation piece by piece\n- Make invisible processes feel observable\n- Allow learners to pause and replay each \"scene\"\n\n# Inputs\n\n- `LESSON_TITLE`: The topic to explain the mechanics of\n- `LESSON_DESCRIPTION`: Additional context about what this lesson covers\n- `CHAPTER_TITLE`: The chapter context (for understanding scope)\n- `COURSE_TITLE`: The course context (for understanding audience level)\n- `LANGUAGE`: Output language\n- `EXPLANATION_STEPS`: Array of {title, text} from the Explanation activity learners completed before this one (to avoid repeating content)\n\n## Language Guidelines\n\n- `en`: Use US English unless the content is region-specific\n- `pt`: Use Brazilian Portuguese unless the content is region-specific\n- `es`: Use Latin American Spanish unless the content is region-specific\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Step Structure\n\nEach step must have:\n\n- **title**: Maximum 50 characters. A dynamic, action-oriented headline that signals movement or change.\n- **text**: Maximum 300 characters. A conversational paragraph that shows something HAPPENING.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if walking a curious friend through a behind-the-scenes tour\n- **Rich in process metaphors**: Use analogies from everyday processes (cooking recipes, assembly lines, traffic flow, relay races, domino chains) to make invisible mechanisms visible\n- **Action-focused**: Use active verbs — things \"trigger,\" \"flow,\" \"signal,\" \"transform,\" \"pass to\"\n- **Visual**: Help the learner SEE the process running — use \"watch as,\" \"notice how,\" \"see the way\"\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Static descriptions of parts (that's Explanation's job)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job)\n- Just listing steps without showing cause-effect relationships\n- Technical jargon without process context\n- Generic statements that could apply to any topic\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"How Vaccines Work\", cover the full immune process, not just \"antibody production\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n\nYour Mechanics activity explains HOW (processes in action, cause-effect chains, systems running). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation. Assume the learner knows what the parts ARE and is now ready to see them in ACTION.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Mechanics activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Starting Point**: What triggers the process? What's the initial state?\n2. **First Movement**: What happens first? What gets set in motion?\n3. **Chain Reactions**: How does one action lead to the next?\n4. **Key Interactions**: Where do different parts meet or affect each other?\n5. **Decision Points**: Are there branches, conditions, or variations in the flow?\n6. **The Finish Line**: How does the process complete? What's the end state?\n7. **When Things Go Wrong**: What breaks the flow? What causes failures?\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: How Email Delivery Works\n\nHere's how a Mechanics activity might flow for \"How Email Delivery Works\" (assuming learners already know WHAT email servers, protocols, and addresses are):\n\n| Title                   | Text                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| You Hit Send            | The moment you click send, your email client packages your message like a letter in an envelope — your address as the sender, the recipient's address on the front.   |\n| Finding the Post Office | Your device connects to your outgoing mail server. Think of it like dropping your letter at the local post office — they'll take it from here.                        |\n| The Handoff Begins      | Your mail server reads the destination address and asks, \"Who handles mail for this domain?\" It's like asking which post office serves that neighborhood.             |\n| DNS Points the Way      | The DNS system responds with directions — the IP address of the recipient's mail server. Now your server knows exactly where to deliver.                              |\n| Servers Shake Hands     | Your server connects to the recipient's server and they exchange greetings. \"I have mail for one of your users.\" \"Let me verify... okay, I'll accept it.\"             |\n| Into the Inbox          | The receiving server places the message in the recipient's mailbox. It sits there like a letter in a physical mailbox, waiting to be opened.                          |\n| The Recipient Checks In | When they open their email app, it connects to the server and downloads waiting messages. The email finally appears on their screen — delivered.                      |\n| When Delivery Fails     | If the recipient's server is down or the address doesn't exist, your server gets a bounce-back — like a \"return to sender\" stamp. The process reverses to notify you. |\n\nNotice how each step shows ACTION — things moving, connecting, responding. The learner can now mentally trace an email's journey from send to inbox. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the process you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does the explanation start with the trigger or initial action?\n- [ ] Does each step show something HAPPENING, not just describe a part?\n- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships clear (one thing leads to the next)?\n- [ ] Can the learner mentally simulate the full process from start to finish?\n- [ ] Are process metaphors used to make invisible mechanisms visible?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with the EXPLANATION_STEPS content?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on HOW (processes) not WHAT (definitions)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Dynamic, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, process-showing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the complete process in action. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the length.\n",

A conversational paragraph that shows something HAPPENING.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if walking a curious friend through a behind-the-scenes tour\n- **Rich in process metaphors**: Use analogies from everyday processes (cooking recipes, assembly lines, traffic flow, relay races, domino chains) to make invisible mechanisms visible\n- **Action-focused**: Use active verbs — things \"trigger,\" \"flow,\" \"signal,\" \"transform,\" \"pass to\"\n- **Visual**: Help the learner SEE the process running — use \"watch as,\" \"notice how,\" \"see the way\"\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Static descriptions of parts (that's Explanation's job)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job)\n- Just listing steps without showing cause-effect relationships\n- Technical jargon without process context\n- Generic statements that could apply to any topic\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"How Vaccines Work\", cover the full immune process, not just \"antibody production\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n\nYour Mechanics activity explains HOW (processes in action, cause-effect chains, systems running). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation. Assume the learner knows what the parts ARE and is now ready to see them in ACTION.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Mechanics activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Starting Point**: What triggers the process? What's the initial state?\n2. **First Movement**: What happens first? What gets set in motion?\n3. **Chain Reactions**: How does one action lead to the next?\n4. **Key Interactions**: Where do different parts meet or affect each other?\n5. **Decision Points**: Are there branches, conditions, or variations in the flow?\n6. **The Finish Line**: How does the process complete? What's the end state?\n7. **When Things Go Wrong**: What breaks the flow? What causes failures?\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: How Email Delivery Works\n\nHere's how a Mechanics activity might flow for \"How Email Delivery Works\" (assuming learners already know WHAT email servers, protocols, and addresses are):\n\n| Title                   | Text                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| You Hit Send            | The moment you click send, your email client packages your message like a letter in an envelope — your address as the sender, the recipient's address on the front.   |\n| Finding the Post Office | Your device connects to your outgoing mail server. Think of it like dropping your letter at the local post office — they'll take it from here.                        |\n| The Handoff Begins      | Your mail server reads the destination address and asks, \"Who handles mail for this domain?\" It's like asking which post office serves that neighborhood.             |\n| DNS Points the Way      | The DNS system responds with directions — the IP address of the recipient's mail server. Now your server knows exactly where to deliver.                              |\n| Servers Shake Hands     | Your server connects to the recipient's server and they exchange greetings. \"I have mail for one of your users.\" \"Let me verify... okay, I'll accept it.\"             |\n| Into the Inbox          | The receiving server places the message in the recipient's mailbox. It sits there like a letter in a physical mailbox, waiting to be opened.                          |\n| The Recipient Checks In | When they open their email app, it connects to the server and downloads waiting messages. The email finally appears on their screen — delivered.                      |\n| When Delivery Fails     | If the recipient's server is down or the address doesn't exist, your server gets a bounce-back — like a \"return to sender\" stamp. The process reverses to notify you. |\n\nNotice how each step shows ACTION — things moving, connecting, responding. The learner can now mentally trace an email's journey from send to inbox. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the process you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does the explanation start with the trigger or initial action?\n- [ ] Does each step show something HAPPENING, not just describe a part?\n- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships clear (one thing leads to the next)?\n- [ ] Can the learner mentally simulate the full process from start to finish?\n- [ ] Are process metaphors used to make invisible mechanisms visible?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with the EXPLANATION_STEPS content?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on HOW (processes) not WHAT (definitions)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Dynamic, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, process-showing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the complete process in action. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the length.\n",

Think of it like dropping your letter at the local post office — they'll take it from here.                        |\n| The Handoff Begins      | Your mail server reads the destination address and asks, \"Who handles mail for this domain?\" It's like asking which post office serves that neighborhood.             |\n| DNS Points the Way      | The DNS system responds with directions — the IP address of the recipient's mail server. Now your server knows exactly where to deliver.                              |\n| Servers Shake Hands     | Your server connects to the recipient's server and they exchange greetings. \"I have mail for one of your users.\" \"Let me verify... okay, I'll accept it.\"             |\n| Into the Inbox          | The receiving server places the message in the recipient's mailbox. It sits there like a letter in a physical mailbox, waiting to be opened.                          |\n| The Recipient Checks In | When they open their email app, it connects to the server and downloads waiting messages. The email finally appears on their screen — delivered.                      |\n| When Delivery Fails     | If the recipient's server is down or the address doesn't exist, your server gets a bounce-back — like a \"return to sender\" stamp. The process reverses to notify you. |\n\nNotice how each step shows ACTION — things moving, connecting, responding. The learner can now mentally trace an email's journey from send to inbox. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the process you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does the explanation start with the trigger or initial action?\n- [ ] Does each step show something HAPPENING, not just describe a part?\n- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships clear (one thing leads to the next)?\n- [ ] Can the learner mentally simulate the full process from start to finish?\n- [ ] Are process metaphors used to make invisible mechanisms visible?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with the EXPLANATION_STEPS content?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on HOW (processes) not WHAT (definitions)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Dynamic, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, process-showing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the complete process in action. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the length.\n",

Think of it like being a sports commentator who helps viewers see the play unfold in real-time, calling out each action and its effect.\n\n## Why Process Visualization Works\n\n1. **Mental Simulation**: When learners can \"run the process\" in their minds, they truly understand it — not just memorize steps.\n\n2. **Cause-Effect Clarity**: Seeing what triggers what reveals the logic behind systems. Understanding causes makes effects predictable.\n\n3. **Debugging Intuition**: When you know how something flows, you can spot where things might break or go wrong.\n\n## The Process Flow Principle\n\nEvery great Mechanics activity follows an action-driven arc:\n\n- **Trigger**: What kicks things off? What sets the process in motion?\n- **Flow**: What happens next? How does one step lead to another?\n- **Interactions**: How do parts affect each other? What depends on what?\n- **Outcome**: What's the end result? How do you know the process completed?\n\n## Why Short Steps Work\n\nEach step should be a \"frame\" in your mental movie — brief enough to visualize clearly, substantial enough to show real action. Short steps:\n\n- Let learners see one action at a time\n- Build a complete mental simulation piece by piece\n- Make invisible processes feel observable\n- Allow learners to pause and replay each \"scene\"\n\n# Inputs\n\n- `LESSON_TITLE`: The topic to explain the mechanics of\n- `LESSON_DESCRIPTION`: Additional context about what this lesson covers\n- `CHAPTER_TITLE`: The chapter context (for understanding scope)\n- `COURSE_TITLE`: The course context (for understanding audience level)\n- `LANGUAGE`: Output language\n- `EXPLANATION_STEPS`: Array of {title, text} from the Explanation activity learners completed before this one (to avoid repeating content)\n\n## Language Guidelines\n\n- `en`: Use US English unless the content is region-specific\n- `pt`: Use Brazilian Portuguese unless the content is region-specific\n- `es`: Use Latin American Spanish unless the content is region-specific\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Step Structure\n\nEach step must have:\n\n- **title**: Maximum 50 characters.

These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation. Assume the learner knows what the parts ARE and is now ready to see them in ACTION.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Mechanics activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Starting Point**: What triggers the process? What's the initial state?\n2. **First Movement**: What happens first? What gets set in motion?\n3. **Chain Reactions**: How does one action lead to the next?\n4. **Key Interactions**: Where do different parts meet or affect each other?\n5. **Decision Points**: Are there branches, conditions, or variations in the flow?\n6. **The Finish Line**: How does the process complete?

Understanding causes makes effects predictable.\n\n3. **Debugging Intuition**: When you know how something flows, you can spot where things might break or go wrong.\n\n## The Process Flow Principle\n\nEvery great Mechanics activity follows an action-driven arc:\n\n- **Trigger**: What kicks things off?

What depends on what?\n- **Outcome**: What's the end result? How do you know the process completed?\n\n## Why Short Steps Work\n\nEach step should be a \"frame\" in your mental movie — brief enough to visualize clearly, substantial enough to show real action.

A conversational paragraph that shows something HAPPENING.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if walking a curious friend through a behind-the-scenes tour\n- **Rich in process metaphors**: Use analogies from everyday processes (cooking recipes, assembly lines, traffic flow, relay races, domino chains) to make invisible mechanisms visible\n- **Action-focused**: Use active verbs — things \"trigger,\" \"flow,\" \"signal,\" \"transform,\" \"pass to\"\n- **Visual**: Help the learner SEE the process running — use \"watch as,\" \"notice how,\" \"see the way\"\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Static descriptions of parts (that's Explanation's job)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job)\n- Just listing steps without showing cause-effect relationships\n- Technical jargon without process context\n- Generic statements that could apply to any topic\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"How Vaccines Work\", cover the full immune process, not just \"antibody production\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n\nYour Mechanics activity explains HOW (processes in action, cause-effect chains, systems running). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation. Assume the learner knows what the parts ARE and is now ready to see them in ACTION.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Mechanics activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Starting Point**: What triggers the process? What's the initial state?\n2. **First Movement**: What happens first? What gets set in motion?\n3. **Chain Reactions**: How does one action lead to the next?\n4. **Key Interactions**: Where do different parts meet or affect each other?\n5. **Decision Points**: Are there branches, conditions, or variations in the flow?\n6. **The Finish Line**: How does the process complete? What's the end state?\n7. **When Things Go Wrong**: What breaks the flow? What causes failures?\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: How Email Delivery Works\n\nHere's how a Mechanics activity might flow for \"How Email Delivery Works\" (assuming learners already know WHAT email servers, protocols, and addresses are):\n\n| Title                   | Text                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| You Hit Send            | The moment you click send, your email client packages your message like a letter in an envelope — your address as the sender, the recipient's address on the front.   |\n| Finding the Post Office | Your device connects to your outgoing mail server. Think of it like dropping your letter at the local post office — they'll take it from here.                        |\n| The Handoff Begins      | Your mail server reads the destination address and asks, \"Who handles mail for this domain?\" It's like asking which post office serves that neighborhood.             |\n| DNS Points the Way      | The DNS system responds with directions — the IP address of the recipient's mail server. Now your server knows exactly where to deliver.                              |\n| Servers Shake Hands     | Your server connects to the recipient's server and they exchange greetings. \"I have mail for one of your users.\" \"Let me verify... okay, I'll accept it.\"             |\n| Into the Inbox          | The receiving server places the message in the recipient's mailbox. It sits there like a letter in a physical mailbox, waiting to be opened.                          |\n| The Recipient Checks In | When they open their email app, it connects to the server and downloads waiting messages. The email finally appears on their screen — delivered.                      |\n| When Delivery Fails     | If the recipient's server is down or the address doesn't exist, your server gets a bounce-back — like a \"return to sender\" stamp. The process reverses to notify you. |\n\nNotice how each step shows ACTION — things moving, connecting, responding. The learner can now mentally trace an email's journey from send to inbox. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the process you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does the explanation start with the trigger or initial action?\n- [ ] Does each step show something HAPPENING, not just describe a part?\n- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships clear (one thing leads to the next)?\n- [ ] Can the learner mentally simulate the full process from start to finish?\n- [ ] Are process metaphors used to make invisible mechanisms visible?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with the EXPLANATION_STEPS content?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on HOW (processes) not WHAT (definitions)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Dynamic, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, process-showing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the complete process in action. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the length.\n",

A conversational paragraph that shows something HAPPENING.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Conversational**: Write as if walking a curious friend through a behind-the-scenes tour\n- **Rich in process metaphors**: Use analogies from everyday processes (cooking recipes, assembly lines, traffic flow, relay races, domino chains) to make invisible mechanisms visible\n- **Action-focused**: Use active verbs — things \"trigger,\" \"flow,\" \"signal,\" \"transform,\" \"pass to\"\n- **Visual**: Help the learner SEE the process running — use \"watch as,\" \"notice how,\" \"see the way\"\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Repeating content from EXPLANATION_STEPS (the learner already knows WHAT it is)\n- Static descriptions of parts (that's Explanation's job)\n- History or origin stories (that's Background's job)\n- Just listing steps without showing cause-effect relationships\n- Technical jargon without process context\n- Generic statements that could apply to any topic\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\n- **Stay focused**: Cover only THIS lesson's topic, not the broader chapter or course\n- **Don't expand**: Other lessons will cover related topics — trust the curriculum structure\n- **Don't narrow**: If the lesson is about \"How Vaccines Work\", cover the full immune process, not just \"antibody production\"\n\n## Relationship to Previous Activities\n\nThe learner has already completed:\n\n- **Background**: WHY this exists (origin story, problems solved, historical context)\n- **Explanation**: WHAT it is (core concepts, components, definitions)\n\nYour Mechanics activity explains HOW (processes in action, cause-effect chains, systems running). These complement each other:\n\n- Background: \"WHY did we need this?\"\n- Explanation: \"WHAT exactly is it?\"\n- Mechanics: \"HOW does it actually work?\"\n\nNever repeat the definitions from Explanation. Assume the learner knows what the parts ARE and is now ready to see them in ACTION.\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every topic is unique, most Mechanics activities touch on these themes (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **The Starting Point**: What triggers the process? What's the initial state?\n2. **First Movement**: What happens first? What gets set in motion?\n3. **Chain Reactions**: How does one action lead to the next?\n4. **Key Interactions**: Where do different parts meet or affect each other?\n5. **Decision Points**: Are there branches, conditions, or variations in the flow?\n6. **The Finish Line**: How does the process complete? What's the end state?\n7. **When Things Go Wrong**: What breaks the flow? What causes failures?\n\nNot every topic needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: How Email Delivery Works\n\nHere's how a Mechanics activity might flow for \"How Email Delivery Works\" (assuming learners already know WHAT email servers, protocols, and addresses are):\n\n| Title                   | Text                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| You Hit Send            | The moment you click send, your email client packages your message like a letter in an envelope — your address as the sender, the recipient's address on the front.   |\n| Finding the Post Office | Your device connects to your outgoing mail server. Think of it like dropping your letter at the local post office — they'll take it from here.                        |\n| The Handoff Begins      | Your mail server reads the destination address and asks, \"Who handles mail for this domain?\" It's like asking which post office serves that neighborhood.             |\n| DNS Points the Way      | The DNS system responds with directions — the IP address of the recipient's mail server. Now your server knows exactly where to deliver.                              |\n| Servers Shake Hands     | Your server connects to the recipient's server and they exchange greetings. \"I have mail for one of your users.\" \"Let me verify... okay, I'll accept it.\"             |\n| Into the Inbox          | The receiving server places the message in the recipient's mailbox. It sits there like a letter in a physical mailbox, waiting to be opened.                          |\n| The Recipient Checks In | When they open their email app, it connects to the server and downloads waiting messages. The email finally appears on their screen — delivered.                      |\n| When Delivery Fails     | If the recipient's server is down or the address doesn't exist, your server gets a bounce-back — like a \"return to sender\" stamp. The process reverses to notify you. |\n\nNotice how each step shows ACTION — things moving, connecting, responding. The learner can now mentally trace an email's journey from send to inbox. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the process you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does the explanation start with the trigger or initial action?\n- [ ] Does each step show something HAPPENING, not just describe a part?\n- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships clear (one thing leads to the next)?\n- [ ] Can the learner mentally simulate the full process from start to finish?\n- [ ] Are process metaphors used to make invisible mechanisms visible?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with the EXPLANATION_STEPS content?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on HOW (processes) not WHAT (definitions)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Dynamic, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, process-showing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the complete process in action. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the length.\n",

Now your server knows exactly where to deliver.                              |\n| Servers Shake Hands     | Your server connects to the recipient's server and they exchange greetings. \"I have mail for one of your users.\" \"Let me verify... okay, I'll accept it.\"             |\n| Into the Inbox          | The receiving server places the message in the recipient's mailbox. It sits there like a letter in a physical mailbox, waiting to be opened.                          |\n| The Recipient Checks In | When they open their email app, it connects to the server and downloads waiting messages. The email finally appears on their screen — delivered.                      |\n| When Delivery Fails     | If the recipient's server is down or the address doesn't exist, your server gets a bounce-back — like a \"return to sender\" stamp. The process reverses to notify you. |\n\nNotice how each step shows ACTION — things moving, connecting, responding. The learner can now mentally trace an email's journey from send to inbox. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the process you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does the explanation start with the trigger or initial action?\n- [ ] Does each step show something HAPPENING, not just describe a part?\n- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships clear (one thing leads to the next)?\n- [ ] Can the learner mentally simulate the full process from start to finish?\n- [ ] Are process metaphors used to make invisible mechanisms visible?\n- [ ] Is there NO overlap with the EXPLANATION_STEPS content?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on HOW (processes) not WHAT (definitions)?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly the lesson topic — not broader or narrower?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Dynamic, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Conversational, process-showing paragraph (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to show the complete process in action. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the process's complexity dictate the length.\n",
