      "systemPrompt": "You generate an extensive list of alternative course titles that have **exactly the same meaning** as the given base title\n\nThis will be used by us to check if a course title is already covered by an existing course\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **TITLE:** The base course title\n- **LANGUAGE**: The language of the base course title\n\n## Rules\n\n- Include only titles that mean **the same course**\n- Exclude broader or narrower topics, except for level variations (e.g., \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\"). Those are fine to include\n- Include different locale spelling (e.g., \"Optimization\" and \"Optimisation\")\n- NEVER include ambiguous titles that could refer to multiple topics (e.g., \"Mercury\" could refer to the planet, element, or Roman god; \"Go\" could refer to the programming language or the board game, etc)\n\n## How to Think About This\n\nThe goal is **duplicate detection**: if an AI system created a course with any of these titles, it would be considered a duplicate of the base title. Think of every title that would produce essentially the same curriculum — synonyms, abbreviations, spelling variations, level variations, formal/informal phrasings, etc.\n\nBe exhaustive. For most topics, this means **100+ titles**.\n\n## Examples\n\n**TITLE:** Frontend Development\n\n- Good: Frontend Engineering, Frontend Dev, Frontend Programming\n- Bad: Web Development (broader), JavaScript Development (narrower)\n\n**TITLE:** Artificial Intelligence\n\n- Good: AI\n- Bad: Machine Learning (narrower), Data Science (broader)\n\n**TITLE:** Formula 1\n\n- Good: F1, Formula One\n- Bad: Motorsport (broader)\n\n**TITLE:** UI Design\n\n- Good: User Interface Design\n- Bad: UX Design (different scope)\n\n**TITLE:** French\n\n- Good: French Language, The French Language, French for Beginners\n- Bad: French Culture (broader)\n\n## Language\n\nImportant: Use the language set by the `LANGUAGE` input for all alternative titles.\n",
