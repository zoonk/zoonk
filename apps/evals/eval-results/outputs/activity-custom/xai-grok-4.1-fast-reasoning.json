Any tools, accounts, or files needed?\n2. **Starting Point**: Where does the learner begin? What do they open or navigate to?\n3. **Core Actions**: The main sequence of steps to complete the task\n4. **Verification Points**: Checks along the way to confirm progress\n5. **Completion**: The final step and how to know the task is done\n\nNot every procedure needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Set Up SSH Keys\n\nHere's how a Custom activity might flow for \"Set Up SSH Keys\" within a lesson about Git authentication:\n\n| Title            | Text                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Open Terminal    | Launch your terminal application. On Mac, find it in Applications > Utilities. On Windows, open Git Bash.                                                       |\n| Generate the Key | Type `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your@email.com\"` and press Enter. Replace the email with your actual GitHub email.                                              |\n| Choose Location  | Press Enter to accept the default file location, or type a custom path if needed.                                                                               |\n| Set a Passphrase | Enter a secure passphrase when prompted. This adds extra security to your key. You can leave it empty by pressing Enter twice, but a passphrase is recommended. |\n| Start SSH Agent  | Run `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` to start the SSH agent in the background. You should see a message like \"Agent pid 12345\".                                         |\n| Add Key to Agent | Type `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` to add your new key to the SSH agent. You'll see \"Identity added\" when successful.                                             |\n| Copy Public Key  | Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and copy the entire output to your clipboard. It starts with \"ssh-ed25519\" and ends with your email.                            |\n| Verify Setup     | Test the connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`. You should see a message saying \"Hi username! You've successfully authenticated.\"                             |\n\nNotice how each step is a single action with clear instructions. The learner can follow along and complete the task without needing to understand SSH theory. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the procedure you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step contain exactly ONE action?\n- [ ] Are imperative verbs used (Click, Type, Open, Select, etc.)?\n- [ ] Are verification cues included where helpful (\"You should see...\", \"It will show...\")?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly what ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION specify?\n- [ ] Are instructions specific (exact button names, menu paths, commands)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on DO (actions) not WHAT (concepts) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Can the learner complete this procedure by following the steps exactly?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Imperative, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Clear, specific instructions for completing the action (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to guide the learner through the complete procedure. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the length.\n",

Any tools, accounts, or files needed?\n2. **Starting Point**: Where does the learner begin? What do they open or navigate to?\n3. **Core Actions**: The main sequence of steps to complete the task\n4. **Verification Points**: Checks along the way to confirm progress\n5. **Completion**: The final step and how to know the task is done\n\nNot every procedure needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Set Up SSH Keys\n\nHere's how a Custom activity might flow for \"Set Up SSH Keys\" within a lesson about Git authentication:\n\n| Title            | Text                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Open Terminal    | Launch your terminal application. On Mac, find it in Applications > Utilities. On Windows, open Git Bash.                                                       |\n| Generate the Key | Type `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your@email.com\"` and press Enter. Replace the email with your actual GitHub email.                                              |\n| Choose Location  | Press Enter to accept the default file location, or type a custom path if needed.                                                                               |\n| Set a Passphrase | Enter a secure passphrase when prompted. This adds extra security to your key. You can leave it empty by pressing Enter twice, but a passphrase is recommended. |\n| Start SSH Agent  | Run `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` to start the SSH agent in the background. You should see a message like \"Agent pid 12345\".                                         |\n| Add Key to Agent | Type `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` to add your new key to the SSH agent. You'll see \"Identity added\" when successful.                                             |\n| Copy Public Key  | Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and copy the entire output to your clipboard. It starts with \"ssh-ed25519\" and ends with your email.                            |\n| Verify Setup     | Test the connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`. You should see a message saying \"Hi username! You've successfully authenticated.\"                             |\n\nNotice how each step is a single action with clear instructions. The learner can follow along and complete the task without needing to understand SSH theory. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the procedure you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step contain exactly ONE action?\n- [ ] Are imperative verbs used (Click, Type, Open, Select, etc.)?\n- [ ] Are verification cues included where helpful (\"You should see...\", \"It will show...\")?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly what ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION specify?\n- [ ] Are instructions specific (exact button names, menu paths, commands)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on DO (actions) not WHAT (concepts) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Can the learner complete this procedure by following the steps exactly?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Imperative, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Clear, specific instructions for completing the action (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to guide the learner through the complete procedure.

Clear instructions for completing the action, including what to look for to confirm success.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Direct**: Use imperative verbs — \"Click,\" \"Type,\" \"Open,\" \"Add,\" \"Wait,\" \"Select\"\n- **Specific**: Name exact buttons, menus, fields, or locations — avoid vague instructions\n- **Confirmatory**: Include verification cues — \"You should see...\", \"A message will appear...\", \"The button turns green when...\"\n- **Supportive**: Anticipate confusion and provide guidance — \"If you don't see X, try Y\"\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Conceptual explanations\n- Process descriptions\n- History or context\n- Combining multiple actions in one step\n- Vague instructions like \"configure the settings\" without specifics\n- Technical jargon without explaining what to do with it\n- Generic advice that doesn't help complete the specific task\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\nThe activity must match EXACTLY the scope defined by ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION:\n\n- **Not broader**: Don't explain the whole lesson — focus only on this specific activity\n- **Not narrower**: Cover the complete procedure as described in ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION\n- **Stay actionable**: Every step should be something the learner physically does\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every procedure is unique, most Custom activities follow this flow (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **Prerequisites**: What should be ready? Any tools, accounts, or files needed?\n2. **Starting Point**: Where does the learner begin? What do they open or navigate to?\n3. **Core Actions**: The main sequence of steps to complete the task\n4. **Verification Points**: Checks along the way to confirm progress\n5. **Completion**: The final step and how to know the task is done\n\nNot every procedure needs all these elements — some may need more or fewer steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the structure.\n\n# Example: Set Up SSH Keys\n\nHere's how a Custom activity might flow for \"Set Up SSH Keys\" within a lesson about Git authentication:\n\n| Title            | Text                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Open Terminal    | Launch your terminal application. On Mac, find it in Applications > Utilities. On Windows, open Git Bash.                                                       |\n| Generate the Key | Type `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your@email.com\"` and press Enter. Replace the email with your actual GitHub email.                                              |\n| Choose Location  | Press Enter to accept the default file location, or type a custom path if needed.                                                                               |\n| Set a Passphrase | Enter a secure passphrase when prompted. This adds extra security to your key. You can leave it empty by pressing Enter twice, but a passphrase is recommended. |\n| Start SSH Agent  | Run `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` to start the SSH agent in the background. You should see a message like \"Agent pid 12345\".                                         |\n| Add Key to Agent | Type `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` to add your new key to the SSH agent. You'll see \"Identity added\" when successful.                                             |\n| Copy Public Key  | Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and copy the entire output to your clipboard. It starts with \"ssh-ed25519\" and ends with your email.                            |\n| Verify Setup     | Test the connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`. You should see a message saying \"Hi username! You've successfully authenticated.\"                             |\n\nNotice how each step is a single action with clear instructions. The learner can follow along and complete the task without needing to understand SSH theory. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the procedure you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step contain exactly ONE action?\n- [ ] Are imperative verbs used (Click, Type, Open, Select, etc.)?\n- [ ] Are verification cues included where helpful (\"You should see...\", \"It will show...\")?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly what ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION specify?\n- [ ] Are instructions specific (exact button names, menu paths, commands)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on DO (actions) not WHAT (concepts) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Can the learner complete this procedure by following the steps exactly?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Imperative, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Clear, specific instructions for completing the action (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to guide the learner through the complete procedure. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the length.\n",

Replace the email with your actual GitHub email.                                              |\n| Choose Location  | Press Enter to accept the default file location, or type a custom path if needed.                                                                               |\n| Set a Passphrase | Enter a secure passphrase when prompted. This adds extra security to your key. You can leave it empty by pressing Enter twice, but a passphrase is recommended. |\n| Start SSH Agent  | Run `eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"` to start the SSH agent in the background. You should see a message like \"Agent pid 12345\".                                         |\n| Add Key to Agent | Type `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` to add your new key to the SSH agent. You'll see \"Identity added\" when successful.                                             |\n| Copy Public Key  | Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and copy the entire output to your clipboard. It starts with \"ssh-ed25519\" and ends with your email.                            |\n| Verify Setup     | Test the connection with `ssh -T git@github.com`. You should see a message saying \"Hi username! You've successfully authenticated.\"                             |\n\nNotice how each step is a single action with clear instructions. The learner can follow along and complete the task without needing to understand SSH theory. This is just an example, though. Adapt the structure to the procedure you're explaining. It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step contain exactly ONE action?\n- [ ] Are imperative verbs used (Click, Type, Open, Select, etc.)?\n- [ ] Are verification cues included where helpful (\"You should see...\", \"It will show...\")?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly what ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION specify?\n- [ ] Are instructions specific (exact button names, menu paths, commands)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on DO (actions) not WHAT (concepts) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Can the learner complete this procedure by following the steps exactly?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Imperative, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Clear, specific instructions for completing the action (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to guide the learner through the complete procedure. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the length.\n",

Think of it like being a patient instructor standing beside the learner, telling them exactly what to do next and confirming they're on track.\n\n## Why Procedural Clarity Works\n\n1. **Action Over Theory**: Learners build skills by DOING. Clear instructions get them moving immediately without getting stuck.\n\n2. **Confidence Through Progress**: Each completed step builds momentum. Learners see themselves succeeding and stay motivated.\n\n3. **Error Prevention**: Well-designed instructions anticipate confusion and guide learners past common pitfalls before they happen.\n\n## The Procedural Flow Principle\n\nEvery great Custom activity follows an action-driven arc:\n\n- **Setup**: What should be ready before starting? What tools or conditions are needed?\n- **Action**: What specific action should the learner take right now?\n- **Verification**: How does the learner know they did it correctly?\n- **Completion**: What's the end state that confirms success?\n\n## Why Single Actions Work\n\nEach step should be ONE action — brief enough to complete without confusion, substantial enough to make real progress. Single-action steps:\n\n- Prevent learners from getting lost mid-instruction\n- Make it easy to recover if something goes wrong\n- Build a rhythm of action and confirmation\n- Allow learners to pause and resume without losing their place\n\n# Inputs\n\n- `LESSON_TITLE`: The lesson this activity belongs to\n- `LESSON_DESCRIPTION`: Additional context about what this lesson covers\n- `CHAPTER_TITLE`: The chapter context (for understanding scope)\n- `COURSE_TITLE`: The course context (for understanding audience level)\n- `LANGUAGE`: Output language\n- `ACTIVITY_TITLE`: The specific activity to create procedural instructions for\n- `ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION`: Description of what this activity covers\n\n## Language Guidelines\n\n- `en`: Use US English unless the content is region-specific\n- `pt`: Use Brazilian Portuguese unless the content is region-specific\n- `es`: Use Latin American Spanish unless the content is region-specific\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Step Structure\n\nEach step must have:\n\n- **title**: Maximum 50 characters. An imperative, action-oriented headline that tells the learner what to do.\n- **text**: Maximum 300 characters. Clear instructions for completing the action, including what to look for to confirm success.\n\n## Tone & Style\n\n- **Direct**: Use imperative verbs — \"Click,\" \"Type,\" \"Open,\" \"Add,\" \"Wait,\" \"Select\"\n- **Specific**: Name exact buttons, menus, fields, or locations — avoid vague instructions\n- **Confirmatory**: Include verification cues — \"You should see...\", \"A message will appear...\", \"The button turns green when...\"\n- **Supportive**: Anticipate confusion and provide guidance — \"If you don't see X, try Y\"\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n- Conceptual explanations\n- Process descriptions\n- History or context\n- Combining multiple actions in one step\n- Vague instructions like \"configure the settings\" without specifics\n- Technical jargon without explaining what to do with it\n- Generic advice that doesn't help complete the specific task\n- Starting with \"In this activity...\" or similar meta-commentary\n\n## Scope\n\nThe activity must match EXACTLY the scope defined by ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION:\n\n- **Not broader**: Don't explain the whole lesson — focus only on this specific activity\n- **Not narrower**: Cover the complete procedure as described in ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION\n- **Stay actionable**: Every step should be something the learner physically does\n\n# Structure Guide\n\nWhile every procedure is unique, most Custom activities follow this flow (adapt as needed):\n\n1. **Prerequisites**: What should be ready?

It could be more or fewer steps depending on complexity.\n\n# Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n\n- [ ] Does each step contain exactly ONE action?\n- [ ] Are imperative verbs used (Click, Type, Open, Select, etc.)?\n- [ ] Are verification cues included where helpful (\"You should see...\", \"It will show...\")?\n- [ ] Is the scope exactly what ACTIVITY_TITLE and ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION specify?\n- [ ] Are instructions specific (exact button names, menu paths, commands)?\n- [ ] Does the activity focus on DO (actions) not WHAT (concepts) or HOW (processes)?\n- [ ] Can the learner complete this procedure by following the steps exactly?\n- [ ] Are all titles ≤50 characters and all texts ≤300 characters?\n\n# Output Format\n\nReturn an array of steps, each with:\n\n- **title**: Imperative, action-oriented headline (max 50 chars)\n- **text**: Clear, specific instructions for completing the action (max 300 chars)\n\nUse as many steps as needed to guide the learner through the complete procedure. Don't limit yourself to a specific number of steps. Let the task's complexity dictate the length.\n",
