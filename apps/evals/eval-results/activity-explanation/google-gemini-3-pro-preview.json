It accurately covers key properties: one-way function, avalanche effect, fixed length, and collision resistance. The overlap with the background regarding the avalanche effect is handled well; while the background mentioned the phenomenon, this explanation formalizes it as a defined property ('Efecto Avalancha'). One very minor nuance for improvement: in Step 5, stating that distinct files 'never' produce the same hash is theoretically incorrect due to the Pigeonhole Principle (infinite inputs, fixed outputs mean collisions must exist), though they are computationally infeasible to find. Phrasing it as 'virtually impossible' would be more mathematically precise, but for a fundamental level, the current explanation is acceptable.",
