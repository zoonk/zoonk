        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Titles and text must be in Portuguese.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: DNA replication involves specific enzymes with distinct roles in a coordinated process. Penalize if:\n   - Both DNA strands are described as being copied the same way (leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently)\n\n2. DEPTH CHECK: Penalize if the explanation presents DNA replication as simply \"unzipping and copying\" without showing how multiple enzymes coordinate the process.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM BACKGROUND: The background covered the discovery of DNA structure and the templating concept. This should explain the actual molecular machinery of replication.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. FACTUAL ACCURACY: Any scientific processes, mechanisms, or technical details must be correct. Penalize hallucinations, made-up components, or incorrect cause-effect relationships.\n\n2. DEPTH: Complex topics require multi-layered explanations. Penalize superficial overviews that skip essential mechanisms.\n\n3. CLARITY: Steps should build understanding progressively, explaining concepts in accessible language.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like explaining to a curious friend. Include analogies from everyday life.\n\n6. FOCUS: Explains WHAT something IS, not history or origin stories.\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the BACKGROUND_STEPS.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing components, phases, or concepts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of steps\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" explanation\n- ONLY penalize for: factual errors, superficial treatment of complex topics, not using the conversational tone (everyday language) we asked or poor explanation structure\n- Different valid explanatory approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
