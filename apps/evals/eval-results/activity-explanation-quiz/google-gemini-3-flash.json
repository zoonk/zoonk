APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Scenarios where someone observes immune responses in everyday life (repeat exposure, recovery time, vaccination effects) and must explain the underlying mechanism\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring prediction of immune outcomes based on understanding defense layers\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to name cells, list defense mechanisms, or recall definitions without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing specific metaphors or examples from the explanation\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Antibodies directly killing pathogens (they MARK pathogens for destruction by other cells like macrophages)\n   - White blood cells being a single type (there are many types with different functions)\n   - Immune response being immediate (innate response is fast, adaptive takes days)\n   - Fever being harmful (it's often a beneficial immune response)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works well for \"which scenario shows X mechanism.\" Match columns work for connecting symptoms to immune responses. Sort order works for immune response sequence.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Arrange words: TRAP FORMAT. Only valid when understanding the concept is required to know which words go where. PENALIZE HEAVILY when the sentence can be assembled through grammar/syntax knowledge alone (e.g., basic sentence structure like \"Subject + verb + object\" that any native speaker could guess).\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - arrangeWords is used but the sentence structure is trivially guessable from grammar (this is a common failure mode)\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Questions, options, and feedback must be in Portuguese.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Scenarios involving economic decisions (borrowing, spending, saving) where learners must predict effects of interest rate changes\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring understanding of transmission delays between policy and economic outcomes\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to list monetary tools or define economic terms without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing specific examples from the explanation\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Interest rate changes having immediate effects (transmission mechanisms have significant time lags of 6-18 months)\n   - Central banks directly controlling inflation (they influence it through indirect mechanisms)\n   - Lower interest rates always being good (they can fuel inflation and asset bubbles)\n   - Monetary policy being the only tool for economic stability (fiscal policy also plays a role)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works for cause-effect scenarios. Match columns work for connecting policy actions to economic effects. Sort order can work for transmission mechanism sequences.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Arrange words: TRAP FORMAT. Only valid when understanding the concept is required to know which words go where. PENALIZE HEAVILY when the sentence can be assembled through grammar/syntax knowledge alone (e.g., basic sentence structure like \"Subject + verb + object\" that any native speaker could guess).\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - arrangeWords is used but the sentence structure is trivially guessable from grammar (this is a common failure mode)\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Questions, options, and feedback must be in Spanish.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Security scenarios where learners must apply hash properties (irreversibility, avalanche effect, collision resistance) to real situations\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring understanding of why certain hash behaviors matter for security\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to list hash properties or define terminology without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions about specific terms like \"avalanche effect\" without practical application\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Hashing being the same as encryption (hashing is ONE-WAY and irreversible; encryption is designed to be reversible with a key)\n   - Hash functions producing unique outputs (collisions are mathematically possible, just extremely unlikely for good functions)\n   - Longer hashes always being more secure (algorithm quality matters more than length)\n   - MD5 or SHA-1 being secure for cryptographic purposes (both have known vulnerabilities)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works for security scenarios. Match columns work for connecting hash properties to their practical implications.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Arrange words: TRAP FORMAT. Only valid when understanding the concept is required to know which words go where. PENALIZE HEAVILY when the sentence can be assembled through grammar/syntax knowledge alone (e.g., basic sentence structure like \"Subject + verb + object\" that any native speaker could guess).\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - arrangeWords is used but the sentence structure is trivially guessable from grammar (this is a common failure mode)\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

        "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Geographic scenarios where learners must explain geological features or patterns based on plate interactions\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring prediction of geological activity based on understanding boundary types\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to name boundary types or list geological features without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing the \"cracked shell\" or \"engine below\" metaphors from the explanation\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - The mantle being liquid or molten (it is SOLID rock that flows very slowly over geological time due to heat and pressure)\n   - Plates floating on liquid (they move on the slowly-flowing solid mantle)\n   - Earthquakes only happening at plate boundaries (intraplate earthquakes exist)\n   - Continental drift being the same as plate tectonics (continental drift was the early theory; plate tectonics is the modern mechanism)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works well for geological scenarios. Match columns work for connecting geological features to boundary types. Sort order could work for mountain-building sequences.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Arrange words: TRAP FORMAT. Only valid when understanding the concept is required to know which words go where. PENALIZE HEAVILY when the sentence can be assembled through grammar/syntax knowledge alone (e.g., basic sentence structure like \"Subject + verb + object\" that any native speaker could guess).\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - arrangeWords is used but the sentence structure is trivially guessable from grammar (this is a common failure mode)\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Scenarios requiring understanding of WHY replication works as it does (directionality constraints, error correction needs)\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations where learners must predict outcomes of replication errors or enzyme malfunctions\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to name enzymes or describe their functions without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing the \"zipper\" metaphor or other explanation-specific content\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Both DNA strands being synthesized the same way (leading strand is continuous; lagging strand is synthesized in Okazaki fragments)\n   - DNA polymerase being able to start synthesis on its own (it needs a primer)\n   - Replication being error-free (proofreading catches most errors but some slip through)\n   - Replication happening randomly along the chromosome (it starts at specific origins)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Sort order works well for replication sequence. Fill blank works for enzyme roles. Multiple choice for understanding why the process works as it does.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Arrange words: TRAP FORMAT. Only valid when understanding the concept is required to know which words go where. PENALIZE HEAVILY when the sentence can be assembled through grammar/syntax knowledge alone (e.g., basic sentence structure like \"Subject + verb + object\" that any native speaker could guess).\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - arrangeWords is used but the sentence structure is trivially guessable from grammar (this is a common failure mode)\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair.

        "expectations": "\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATION: This is an edge case - a visual/practical skill where understanding is demonstrated through application to real scenarios, not visual recognition.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Photography scenarios where learners must decide subject placement to achieve specific visual effects\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring understanding of WHY off-center placement creates visual interest\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to define the rule of thirds or describe the grid without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions about \"power points\" terminology without practical application\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Rule of thirds being mandatory (it's a guideline, not a rule - breaking it intentionally can be effective)\n   - Centered subjects always being wrong (centered composition works for symmetry and certain moods)\n   - The grid being visible in final photos (it's an imaginary guide)\n   - Rule of thirds being the only composition technique (leading lines, framing, and many others exist)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works for \"where would you place the subject\" scenarios. Match columns could connect composition choices to their visual effects. AVOID selectImage unless visual recognition is truly being tested.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Arrange words: TRAP FORMAT. Only valid when understanding the concept is required to know which words go where. PENALIZE HEAVILY when the sentence can be assembled through grammar/syntax knowledge alone (e.g., basic sentence structure like \"Subject + verb + object\" that any native speaker could guess).\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - arrangeWords is used but the sentence structure is trivially guessable from grammar (this is a common failure mode)\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
