Spaghetti Carbonara requires the pasta to be piping hot to emulsify the sauce (Activity 5). If a learner follows this linear sequence, they will finish cooking the pasta, then spend 5-10 minutes preparing the sauce base (grating, separating eggs), during which the pasta will cool and clump. Activity 4 should precede Activity 3 to ensure the sauce base is ready the moment the pasta is cooked.",
