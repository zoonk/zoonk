STRUCTURE - IMMERSIVE STORY FORMAT (CRITICAL):\n   The activity MUST follow the immersive story structure:\n   - A clear scenario description in the NATIVE language\n   - 5-10 dialogue steps with natural progression\n   - Each step has: context (TARGET), contextTranslation (NATIVE), contextRomanization, 4 options\n   - Exactly 1 correct option per step\n   Penalize SEVERELY if any structural element is missing or malformed.\n\n2. SCENARIO QUALITY:\n   - Scenario MUST describe a realistic everyday situation\n   - Should be relevant to the lesson topic\n   - Setting should be clear and immersive\n   - Appropriate for language learners (not overly complex situations)\n   Penalize if scenario is vague, unrealistic, or unrelated to the lesson.\n\n3. CONTEXT DIALOGUE:\n   - Context MUST be in the TARGET language\n   - Context represents what the native speaker says\n   - contextTranslation MUST accurately translate the context to NATIVE language\n   - Dialogue should be natural, not stilted or textbook-like\n   Penalize if context is unnatural or translation is inaccurate.\n\n4. OPTIONS DESIGN (CRITICAL - IMMERSION PRINCIPLE):\n   - Options MUST show only TARGET language text (NO translations)\n   - All 4 options MUST be grammatically correct in TARGET language\n   - Options should represent meaningfully different responses\n   - textRomanization provided for non-Roman scripts, empty string for Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if options include translations or hints in NATIVE language\n   - Penalize if options are grammatically incorrect or nonsensical\n\n5. FEEDBACK DESIGN (CRITICAL):\n   - Every feedback MUST include the translation of what the learner said\n   - Feedback MUST explain why the choice is correct or incorrect\n   - For incorrect options: explain what would be better\n   - Feedback is in NATIVE language\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if feedback is missing translation\n   - Penalize if feedback doesn't explain the reasoning\n\n6.

STORY ARC AND PROGRESSION:\n   - Steps should follow a natural conversation flow\n   - Story should have: opening, building, resolution, closing\n   - Complication is optional but adds realism (e.g., item unavailable, clarification needed)\n   - Each step should logically follow from the previous\n   - The native speaker should acknowledge the learner's previous choice\n   Penalize if steps feel disconnected or conversation doesn't flow naturally.\n\n8. LINGUISTIC ACCURACY (CRITICAL):\n   - ALL target language text must be grammatically correct\n   - ALL translations must be accurate and natural\n   - Register (formal/informal) should be appropriate for the situation\n   - Cultural context should be accurate\n   Penalize SEVERELY for incorrect grammar, mistranslations, or inappropriate register.\n\n9. DISTRACTOR QUALITY (CRITICAL):\n   Wrong options MUST be genuinely wrong - they would cause miscommunication or confusion if used.\n\n   GOOD distractors (genuinely wrong):\n   - Answer a different question (asking about price when asked about quantity)\n   - Request the wrong thing (one-way ticket when you need round-trip)\n   - Are off-topic (asking for the check when you just arrived)\n   - Would cause confusion (saying \"no\" when you mean \"yes\")\n\n   BAD distractors (penalize these):\n   - More/less formal versions of the correct answer that would still work\n   - Slightly different phrasings that communicate the same thing\n   - \"Less polished\" versions that a native speaker would still understand\n\n   Example: If ordering coffee, \"Where is the bathroom?\" is a GOOD distractor (off-topic).\n   \"I would like your finest coffee\" vs \"A coffee please\" are BOTH correct - don't use one as a distractor for the other.\n\n   Penalize SEVERELY if distractors are just stylistic variations that would still accomplish the communication goal.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific dialogue choices - accept ANY natural conversation\n- Do NOT require specific phrases or sentence structures\n- Do NOT penalize for different valid cultural approaches\n- FOCUS ON: structural correctness, immersion principle (no translations in options), feedback quality, romanization correctness\n- The eval model should judge whether the activity creates an immersive language experience, not whether it matches predetermined answers\n\n    ",

SCENARIO QUALITY:\n   - Scenario MUST describe a realistic everyday situation\n   - Should be relevant to the lesson topic\n   - Setting should be clear and immersive\n   - Appropriate for language learners (not overly complex situations)\n   Penalize if scenario is vague, unrealistic, or unrelated to the lesson.\n\n3. CONTEXT DIALOGUE:\n   - Context MUST be in the TARGET language\n   - Context represents what the native speaker says\n   - contextTranslation MUST accurately translate the context to NATIVE language\n   - Dialogue should be natural, not stilted or textbook-like\n   Penalize if context is unnatural or translation is inaccurate.\n\n4. OPTIONS DESIGN (CRITICAL - IMMERSION PRINCIPLE):\n   - Options MUST show only TARGET language text (NO translations)\n   - All 4 options MUST be grammatically correct in TARGET language\n   - Options should represent meaningfully different responses\n   - textRomanization provided for non-Roman scripts, empty string for Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if options include translations or hints in NATIVE language\n   - Penalize if options are grammatically incorrect or nonsensical\n\n5. FEEDBACK DESIGN (CRITICAL):\n   - Every feedback MUST include the translation of what the learner said\n   - Feedback MUST explain why the choice is correct or incorrect\n   - For incorrect options: explain what would be better\n   - Feedback is in NATIVE language\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if feedback is missing translation\n   - Penalize if feedback doesn't explain the reasoning\n\n6. ROMANIZATION (CRITICAL):\n   - For non-Roman scripts (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.):\n     BOTH contextRomanization AND textRomanization MUST be included and accurate\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, etc.):\n     BOTH romanization fields MUST be empty strings \"\"\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization contains text for Roman scripts\n\n7. STORY ARC AND PROGRESSION:\n   - Steps should follow a natural conversation flow\n   - Story should have: opening, building, resolution, closing\n   - Complication is optional but adds realism (e.g., item unavailable, clarification needed)\n   - Each step should logically follow from the previous\n   - The native speaker should acknowledge the learner's previous choice\n   Penalize if steps feel disconnected or conversation doesn't flow naturally.\n\n8. LINGUISTIC ACCURACY (CRITICAL):\n   - ALL target language text must be grammatically correct\n   - ALL translations must be accurate and natural\n   - Register (formal/informal) should be appropriate for the situation\n   - Cultural context should be accurate\n   Penalize SEVERELY for incorrect grammar, mistranslations, or inappropriate register.\n\n9. DISTRACTOR QUALITY (CRITICAL):\n   Wrong options MUST be genuinely wrong - they would cause miscommunication or confusion if used.\n\n   GOOD distractors (genuinely wrong):\n   - Answer a different question (asking about price when asked about quantity)\n   - Request the wrong thing (one-way ticket when you need round-trip)\n   - Are off-topic (asking for the check when you just arrived)\n   - Would cause confusion (saying \"no\" when you mean \"yes\")\n\n   BAD distractors (penalize these):\n   - More/less formal versions of the correct answer that would still work\n   - Slightly different phrasings that communicate the same thing\n   - \"Less polished\" versions that a native speaker would still understand\n\n   Example: If ordering coffee, \"Where is the bathroom?\" is a GOOD distractor (off-topic).\n   \"I would like your finest coffee\" vs \"A coffee please\" are BOTH correct - don't use one as a distractor for the other.\n\n   Penalize SEVERELY if distractors are just stylistic variations that would still accomplish the communication goal.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific dialogue choices - accept ANY natural conversation\n- Do NOT require specific phrases or sentence structures\n- Do NOT penalize for different valid cultural approaches\n- FOCUS ON: structural correctness, immersion principle (no translations in options), feedback quality, romanization correctness\n- The eval model should judge whether the activity creates an immersive language experience, not whether it matches predetermined answers\n\n    ",
