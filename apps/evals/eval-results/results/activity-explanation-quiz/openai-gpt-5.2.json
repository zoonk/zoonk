The question asks which stage 'flags' the error when a reserved keyword is used as an identifier (e.g., `total=price*taxRate`). The provided correct answer is 'Lexical analysis'. However, in standard compiler implementation, the Lexer successfully tokenizes the reserved word as a `KEYWORD` token. It is the **Parser** (Syntax Analysis) that flags the error because the grammar expects an `IDENTIFIER` token at that position, not a `KEYWORD`. While the root cause is the lexical classification, the stage that detects and reports the structural violation is Parsing. Marking 'Lexical analysis' as the correct answer penalizes students who correctly understand the separation of concerns in compilers.",

While correct, the prompt mentions using `sortOrder` when the concept is about sequence (like biological processes). Since neural network training is a cyclical process (Forward -> Loss -> Backprop -> Update), a `sortOrder` question might have been slightly more aligned with the concept's sequential nature than matching definitions. However, `matchColumns` is still a valid choice here as it tests the definition of the stages. Additionally, Q3 introduces the term 'learning rate', which wasn't explicitly in the source text (text used 'Small Steps'), but the option text explains the concept ('updates overshoot'), making it a fair test of understanding.",

Additionally, Question 6 contains an item about 'remembering more mistakes by the other side after a debate', which closely mirrors the 'political supporter' example in the text. This violates Non-Negotiable Rule #3 ('Use novel scenarios').",

        "expectations": "\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATION: This is an edge case - an abstract psychological concept where understanding means recognizing the bias in everyday situations.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Everyday scenarios where learners must recognize confirmation bias operating in someone's reasoning\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring understanding of WHY the bias is unconscious and hard to overcome\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to define confirmation bias or list its characteristics without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions about the sports fan or political supporter examples from the explanation\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Confirmation bias being intentional deception (it's usually unconscious)\n   - Only unintelligent people having confirmation bias (everyone is susceptible, including experts)\n   - Confirmation bias being easy to overcome once you know about it (awareness helps but doesn't eliminate it)\n   - Confirmation bias only affecting beliefs about facts (it affects emotional and value-based beliefs too)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice excels here - present scenarios and ask which demonstrates the bias. Match columns could connect cognitive biases to example scenarios. AVOID sort_order as the concept isn't sequential.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3.
