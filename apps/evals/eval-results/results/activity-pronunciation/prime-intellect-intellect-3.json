NATIVE LANGUAGE PHONEMES ONLY (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - The pronunciation MUST use ONLY letters and letter combinations that exist in the native language\n   - A native speaker should be able to read it without any special knowledge\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if IPA symbols, foreign letters, or non-standard diacritics are used\n   - Penalize if letter combinations don't naturally occur in the native language\n\n2. STRESS INDICATION:\n   - Stressed syllable should be marked with CAPITAL letters\n   - For multi-syllable words, exactly one syllable should be capitalized\n   - For single-syllable words, the entire word may be capitalized\n   - Penalize if stress is not indicated at all\n   - Do NOT penalize for different but valid stress placements if linguistically acceptable\n\n3.
