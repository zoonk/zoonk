          "conclusion": "The syllable 'vol' corresponds to the Portuguese sound /vow/ (vocalized L). An American English speaker reading 'vol' might pronounce it with an open /ɑ/ (as in 'volume') rather than the closed /o/. A representation like 'vohl' or 'voh-w' might capture the vowel quality slightly better, but 'vol' is a very common and readable approximation that avoids confusion. This is not a deduction.",
