While 'ti' in Brazilian Portuguese is often pronounced 'chee' (palatalized), the prompt instructions specifically list mapping the English short 'i' to the Portuguese 'i', and the provided example for 'water' uses a 't' ('UÓ-ter') rather than a flap approximation ('r'), validating the use of 't' here. The result is consistent with the prompt's internal logic and constraints.",
