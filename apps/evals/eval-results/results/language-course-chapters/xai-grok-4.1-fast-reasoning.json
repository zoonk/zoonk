'Koto ga arimasu' typically indicates past experience (have done) or occasional occurrence (sometimes do), not future intentions/plans (which would be 'tsumori', 'yotei', or volitional form). Additionally, 'yoon' in the Hiragana/Katakana descriptions is a typo for 'yōon'.",

Introducing 100 kanji before basic vocabulary and sentence structure is poor pedagogical progression; kanji should be introduced gradually alongside relevant vocabulary. The term 'Inchoativo' (Chapter 61) is technically correct in linguistics but overly academic for a general curriculum; 'Mudança de Estado' would be clearer. 'Voz Reflexiva' is also a term more common in Romance linguistics than Japanese pedagogy (usually handled via transitive/intransitive pairs or 'jibun').",
