'Daily Routine' (Chapter 6) heavily relies on reflexive verbs in Spanish (levatarse, ducharse, etc.), but 'Reflexive Verbs and Pronouns' is not introduced until Chapter 22. Similarly, 'City Navigation and Directions' (Chapter 13) relies on the imperative mood for giving directions, but 'The Imperative Mood' is not covered until Chapter 31. 'Present Tense Fundamentals' (Chapter 10) also comes after several chapters (Family, Food, Shopping) that would practically require verb conjugation.",
