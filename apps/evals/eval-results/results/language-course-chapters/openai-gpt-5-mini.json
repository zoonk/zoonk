The JSON formatting is correct. However, while the instructions and expectations explicitly mentioned covering 'ser vs estar', there is no dedicated chapter with this title. In Spanish curricula, 'Ser vs Estar' is a critical concept usually distinct from general 'Present Simple' or 'Adjectives'. While likely covered within those chapters, its absence as a standalone title is a minor omission given the specific expectations.",
