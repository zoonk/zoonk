Second, the instruction 'NO skill-based chapters' was violated by including chapters focused on reading and writing skills, specifically 'Complex Texts & Critical Analysis' (description begins with 'Advanced reading of...') and 'Letters & Formal Correspondence' (description begins with 'Writing and understanding...').",
