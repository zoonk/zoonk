(2) Some chapters edge toward meta/learning-process framing rather than Spanish content (e.g., \"Automaticity in Complex Structures\"), though the descriptions keep them tied to grammar usage. (3) A few descriptions include mildly instructional phrasing (e.g., \"avoiding common errors\") which is close to the banned-fluff guidance, though it’s not the explicit banned verbs and remains concise.",

(2) Add/clarify a few Spanish-specific core areas that are not explicitly called out: accent marks/orthographic contrasts that change meaning (still could be framed as meaning/grammar rather than 'writing skills'), \"lo\" uses (lo + adj, lo de, lo que) beyond nominalization, and \"personal a\" could be made explicit earlier. (3) Consider an explicit chapter on \"Present Perfect vs Preterite\" earlier for learners targeting Latin American vs Peninsular differences (some of this appears later as variation).",
