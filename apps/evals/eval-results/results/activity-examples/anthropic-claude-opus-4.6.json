The response perfectly adheres to the neuroscience expectations, accurately portraying dopamine as the neurotransmitter of anticipation, motivation, and reward prediction rather than merely the 'pleasure chemical'. This is especially well-demonstrated in the exercise example, where it correctly distinguishes between the 'runner's high' and the motivation to put on the shoes.",

It brilliantly translates the abstract concepts from the 'Explanation' step (anticipation, reward loops, tolerance) into highly recognizable, diverse real-world contexts including social media, food, online shopping, exercise, and hobbies.

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Titles and text must be in Portuguese.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Dopamine examples must reflect current neuroscience accurately. Penalize if:\n   - Dopamine is oversimplified as just \"the pleasure chemical\" (it's about motivation/reward prediction)\n   - Examples attribute behaviors to dopamine that involve multiple neurotransmitter systems\n\n2. CONTEXT CHECK: Penalize if examples are limited to addiction. Dopamine is involved in motivation, learning, movement, social behavior, creativity, and goal-directed action.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT dopamine is (a neurotransmitter involved in reward). This should show WHERE dopamine influences behaviors and experiences in daily life.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE: Examples must be concrete, recognizable situations from everyday life. Penalize abstract or theoretical applications without clear real-world grounding.\n\n2. CONTEXT DIVERSITY: Content should show the topic across different life domains (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected places, personal interests). Variety helps different learners connect.\n\n3. RECOGNITION FACTOR: Examples should create \"aha moments\" — helping learners see the topic in familiar places they hadn't noticed before.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like pointing out hidden patterns in everyday life. Include metaphors and analogies from familiar activities.\n\n6. FOCUS: Shows WHERE something appears (real-world contexts), not WHAT it is (definitions) or HOW it works (processes).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific life domains or contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of contexts or examples\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" list of applications\n- ONLY penalize for: incorrect real-world claims, abstract examples without concrete situations, overlap with explanation content, or lack of variety in context types\n- Different valid sets of examples exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
