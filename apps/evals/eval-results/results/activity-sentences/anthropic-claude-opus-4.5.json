In English, 'Good evening' is almost exclusively a greeting, while 'Good night' is the farewell. Translating 'Buenas noches' as 'Good evening' here creates a slight pragmatic clash in English (greeting + farewell statement). Additionally, in sentence 2, '¿Cómo amaneció?' is translated literally as 'How did you wake up?'. While understandable, the natural English equivalent for this greeting context is 'How did you sleep?' or 'How are you this morning?'.",
