APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY:\n   - Sentences should be appropriate for language learners\n   - Avoid overly complex grammatical structures unless the lesson specifically targets advanced learners\n   - Vocabulary beyond the provided words should be at a similar or simpler level\n   - Penalize if sentences are incomprehensible to learners or use excessive advanced vocabulary\n\n9. NO DUPLICATES:\n   - Each sentence should be unique\n   - Avoid near-duplicates (same sentence with minor word changes)\n   - Penalize if essentially the same sentence appears multiple times\n\n10. LANGUAGE CORRECTNESS:\n    - Sentences should be in the TARGET language (courseTitle)\n    - Translations should be in the NATIVE language (language code)\n    - Penalize if languages are swapped or mixed incorrectly\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific sentence choices - accept ANY valid sentences that use the vocabulary\n- Do NOT penalize for not including specific contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of sentences\n- Do NOT expect sentences to follow any particular template or pattern\n- Different valid sentence constructions exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- FOCUS ON: vocabulary usage, translation accuracy, romanization correctness, grammatical correctness, naturalness\n\n    ",
