VOCABULARY WORD USAGE (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - Each generated sentence MUST use at least one of the provided vocabulary words\n   - The words should be used in their natural form (conjugated verbs, declined nouns are acceptable)\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if sentences don't incorporate the provided vocabulary\n   - Penalize if words are used incorrectly or out of context\n\n2. TRANSLATION ACCURACY (CRITICAL):\n   - Each sentence-translation pair MUST be linguistically accurate\n   - The translation must convey the same meaning as the original sentence\n   - Consider regional variations (Brazilian Portuguese vs European, Latin American Spanish vs Castilian)\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if translations are incorrect, incomplete, or misleading\n   - Grammatical structures should be appropriately adapted between languages\n\n3. ROMANIZATION (required field):\n   - For Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.: romanization MUST contain the Roman letter representation of the sentence\n   - Use standard romanization systems (romaji for Japanese, pinyin for Chinese, etc.)\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.): romanization MUST be an empty string \"\"\n   - Penalize if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts or contains text for Roman scripts\n\n4. GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS:\n   - Sentences must be grammatically correct in the target language\n   - Verb conjugations must match the subject\n   - Gender agreement must be correct where applicable\n   - Word order should follow natural patterns of the target language\n   - Penalize for grammar errors, incorrect conjugations, or unnatural constructions\n\n5. SENTENCE NATURALNESS:\n   - Sentences should sound natural to native speakers\n   - Avoid overly literal translations or awkward phrasing\n   - Use appropriate register (formal/informal) for the context\n   - Penalize if sentences sound robotic, unnatural, or like machine translation\n\n6. CONTEXT DIVERSITY:\n   - Sentences should present different contexts or situations\n   - Avoid repetitive sentence structures\n   - Use variety in sentence types (statements, questions, commands where appropriate)\n   - Do NOT penalize for covering similar themes if vocabulary words naturally relate to each other\n\n7. LESSON RELEVANCE:\n   - Sentences should relate to the lesson topic\n   - The contexts should be appropriate for the lesson's educational goals\n   - Avoid straying into unrelated topics\n   - Do NOT require every sentence to explicitly reference the lesson topic - implicit relevance is fine\n\n8. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY:\n   - Sentences should be appropriate for language learners\n   - Avoid overly complex grammatical structures unless the lesson specifically targets advanced learners\n   - Vocabulary beyond the provided words should be at a similar or simpler level\n   - Penalize if sentences are incomprehensible to learners or use excessive advanced vocabulary\n\n9. NO DUPLICATES:\n   - Each sentence should be unique\n   - Avoid near-duplicates (same sentence with minor word changes)\n   - Penalize if essentially the same sentence appears multiple times\n\n10. LANGUAGE CORRECTNESS:\n    - Sentences should be in the TARGET language (courseTitle)\n    - Translations should be in the NATIVE language (language code)\n    - Penalize if languages are swapped or mixed incorrectly\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific sentence choices - accept ANY valid sentences that use the vocabulary\n- Do NOT penalize for not including specific contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of sentences\n- Do NOT expect sentences to follow any particular template or pattern\n- Different valid sentence constructions exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- FOCUS ON: vocabulary usage, translation accuracy, romanization correctness, grammatical correctness, naturalness\n\n    ",
