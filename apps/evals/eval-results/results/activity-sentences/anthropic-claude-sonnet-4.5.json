The provided 'sayyaaratu' implies a definite or construct state, which is grammatically incorrect for the sentence structure.\n4.

Item 16 ('ลาก่อนค่ะ แรกพุ่งนี้') contains gibberish/typos ('แรกพุ่งนี้' is not valid Thai; likely intended 'แล้วพรุ่งนี้' or 'แล้วพบกัน'). \n2. Item 11 ('ทำกดหล่น') uses the verb 'กด' (to press) instead of the noun 'ปุ่ม' or 'กระดุม' for 'button'. \n3. Item 7 ('ขอโทษได้ไหมคะ') translates 'Excuse me' literally as 'Can I apologize?', which is not used in Thai to get attention. \n4. Item 4 ('ช่วยผ่าน้ำ') uses 'ผ่าน้ำ' (cut/split water) instead of 'ส่งน้ำ' (pass water). \n5. Item 22 ('เดี๋ยวนี้พบกัน') uses 'เดี๋ยวนี้' (right now) instead of 'เดี๋ยว' (soon/in a bit), changing the meaning to 'Meet right now'.",

          "conclusion": "There are repetitive issues with register and naturalness, particularly with 'ได้โปรด' (Please). \n1. The model uses 'ได้โปรด' in casual contexts (Items 4, 9, 13, 17, 21), which sounds overly dramatic or pleading (like 'I beg of you') rather than a polite request. Standard Thai uses 'ช่วย...หน่อย' or polite particles. \n2. Romanization errors exist: Item 14 romanizes 'อาหาร' (food) as 'arai' (what/thing), and Item 18 writes 'tontorn' instead of 'ton'.",

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE: English output required for translations.\n\nTOPIC: Thai sentences for polite expressions - using politeness vocabulary.\n\nSCRIPT: Non-Roman (romanization MUST be included)\n\nVOCABULARY WORDS PROVIDED: ขอบคุณ, ขอโทษ, ได้โปรด, สวัสดี, ลาก่อน\nThese polite expressions MUST appear in the generated sentences.\n\nROMANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- MUST include romanized Thai for all sentences\n- Standard transliteration with tone indicators where helpful\n- Words: ขอบคุณ (khob khun), ขอโทษ (kho thot), etc.\n- Penalize if romanization is missing or unclear\n\nACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize SEVERELY if:\n- Any sentence doesn't use at least one of the provided expressions\n- Politeness particles are missing where required (ครับ/คะ)\n- Translations don't match the Thai sentences\n- Romanization is missing or inconsistent\n\nCONTEXT EXPECTATIONS:\n- Sentences demonstrating polite interactions\n- Social situations requiring courtesy\n- Natural Thai politeness conventions\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. VOCABULARY WORD USAGE (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - Each generated sentence MUST use at least one of the provided vocabulary words\n   - The words should be used in their natural form (conjugated verbs, declined nouns are acceptable)\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if sentences don't incorporate the provided vocabulary\n   - Penalize if words are used incorrectly or out of context\n\n2. TRANSLATION ACCURACY (CRITICAL):\n   - Each sentence-translation pair MUST be linguistically accurate\n   - The translation must convey the same meaning as the original sentence\n   - Consider regional variations (Brazilian Portuguese vs European, Latin American Spanish vs Castilian)\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if translations are incorrect, incomplete, or misleading\n   - Grammatical structures should be appropriately adapted between languages\n\n3. ROMANIZATION (required field):\n   - For Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.: romanization MUST contain the Roman letter representation of the sentence\n   - Use standard romanization systems (romaji for Japanese, pinyin for Chinese, etc.)\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.): romanization MUST be an empty string \"\"\n   - Penalize if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts or contains text for Roman scripts\n\n4. GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS:\n   - Sentences must be grammatically correct in the target language\n   - Verb conjugations must match the subject\n   - Gender agreement must be correct where applicable\n   - Word order should follow natural patterns of the target language\n   - Penalize for grammar errors, incorrect conjugations, or unnatural constructions\n\n5. SENTENCE NATURALNESS:\n   - Sentences should sound natural to native speakers\n   - Avoid overly literal translations or awkward phrasing\n   - Use appropriate register (formal/informal) for the context\n   - Penalize if sentences sound robotic, unnatural, or like machine translation\n\n6. CONTEXT DIVERSITY:\n   - Sentences should present different contexts or situations\n   - Avoid repetitive sentence structures\n   - Use variety in sentence types (statements, questions, commands where appropriate)\n   - Do NOT penalize for covering similar themes if vocabulary words naturally relate to each other\n\n7. LESSON RELEVANCE:\n   - Sentences should relate to the lesson topic\n   - The contexts should be appropriate for the lesson's educational goals\n   - Avoid straying into unrelated topics\n   - Do NOT require every sentence to explicitly reference the lesson topic - implicit relevance is fine\n\n8. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY:\n   - Sentences should be appropriate for language learners\n   - Avoid overly complex grammatical structures unless the lesson specifically targets advanced learners\n   - Vocabulary beyond the provided words should be at a similar or simpler level\n   - Penalize if sentences are incomprehensible to learners or use excessive advanced vocabulary\n\n9. NO DUPLICATES:\n   - Each sentence should be unique\n   - Avoid near-duplicates (same sentence with minor word changes)\n   - Penalize if essentially the same sentence appears multiple times\n\n10.
