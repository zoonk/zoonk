This is not a standard word. Rice noodles are '米粉' (mǐfěn). '饭面' reads like a literal concatenation of Rice + Noodles.\n\n3. **Grammar Errors**:\n   - S11: '他每天晚上喝一杯牛奶在睡觉前面' (He drinks a glass of milk before sleeping). The time phrase '在睡觉前面' is placed after the object, following English word order. In Chinese, the time/condition usually precedes the action: '他在睡觉前喝一杯牛奶'.",
