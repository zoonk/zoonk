However, some chapters are overly dense, compressing vast topics into single entries. For instance, 'Bibliotecas Padrão Essenciais' groups 'os, sys, pathlib, shutil, glob, subprocess, collections, functools, operator, typing' into one chapter. For a mastery-level course, modules like 'collections', 'subprocess', and 'functools' often warrant their own dedicated chapters to cover all nuances. Similarly, the 'Web Development' and 'Data Science' sections could be more granular to strictly meet the 'extensive' expectation (100+ chapters) suggested for complex topics, though the current 70 chapters are very well selected.",
