Following these instructions would be confusing or impossible for a Linux user despite the guide explicitly addressing them in the early steps.

If a step reads naturally and a user can follow it without confusion, it's fine.\n\n4. VERIFICATION POINTS: Where helpful, include confirmation of success. Only penalize if verification is missing for critical/risky actions. Do NOT penalize verification steps as \"padding\" - helping users confirm success is valuable teaching.\n\n5. FORMAT COMPLIANCE:\n   - title: Maximum 50 characters\n   - text: Maximum 300 characters\n\n6. SCOPE ADHERENCE: Content should cover the activity as described. Do not penalize for reasonable setup or verification steps.\n\n7. PRACTICAL FOCUS: Steps should be actionable instructions, not conceptual explanations.\n\nFINAL CHECK: Before penalizing anything, ask yourself: \"Would a reasonable human instructor consider this a genuine problem?\" If not, do not penalize.\n\n    ",
