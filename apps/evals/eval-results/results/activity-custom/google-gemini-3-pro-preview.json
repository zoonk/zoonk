SAFETY CHECK: Penalize if:\n   - Breathing pattern is not mentioned\n   - Back position (neutral spine) is not addressed\n   - Depth guidance is missing or unsafe\n\n3. VERIFICATION CHECK: Penalize if no cues for self-checking form are provided (mirror check, how it should feel).\n\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (READ THIS FIRST - CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing steps you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of steps - let complexity dictate length\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"ideal\" procedure\n- Do NOT interpret rules too literally - use common sense\n- Different valid procedures exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- ONLY penalize for actual problems: incorrect sequence, factual errors, missing critical safety steps, or truly confusing instructions\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. PROCEDURAL ACCURACY: Steps must be in correct sequence. Penalize only if actions are genuinely out of order or skip critical prerequisites.\n\n2. ACTION-ORIENTED LANGUAGE: Each step must use imperative verbs (Click, Type, Add, Place, Turn, etc.). Penalize passive or purely descriptive language.\n\n3. LOGICAL STEP GROUPING: Steps should be coherent units that a user can follow without confusion. This does NOT mean micro-splitting every movement:\n   - ACCEPTABLE: \"Click the File name field and type your document name\" (filling a form field is ONE action)\n   - ACCEPTABLE: \"Pull over safely and turn on hazard lights\" (logically grouped safety actions)\n   - ACCEPTABLE: \"Pour hot water, swirl to warm, then discard\" (continuous motion)\n   - PROBLEMATIC: \"Download the file, install it, configure settings, and restart\" (unrelated actions crammed together)\n   The goal is clarity, not arbitrary splitting. If a step reads naturally and a user can follow it without confusion, it's fine.\n\n4. VERIFICATION POINTS: Where helpful, include confirmation of success.
