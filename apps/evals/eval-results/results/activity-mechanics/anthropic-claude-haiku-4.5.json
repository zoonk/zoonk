It states that \"Killer white blood cells (cytotoxic T cells)\" recognize antibody-tagged pathogens and rupture their membranes. Scientifically, Cytotoxic T cells recognize and destroy *infected host cells* (intracellular threats) via MHC presentation, not free-floating pathogens tagged by antibodies. Antibodies generally mark pathogens for phagocytosis (by macrophages) or activation of the complement system (which causes rupture), not for direct attack by T cells. This step incorrectly conflates the Humoral (antibody) and Cell-Mediated (T cell) immune responses.",

FOCUS: Explains HOW something works (processes in action), not WHAT it is (definitions) or WHY it exists (history).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing process phases or steps you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of steps\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" process description\n- ONLY penalize for: factual errors, static descriptions instead of action-oriented content, missing cause-effect relationships, or poor process flow\n- Different valid process explanations exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
