Additionally, teaching the full conjugation of 'haber' (he, has, ha...) in a chapter about 'everyday actions' is potentially confusing without the context of the Present Perfect tense, as these forms are rarely used as standalone action verbs in modern Spanish. It might be better to exclude the full conjugation if the Present Perfect is covered in a later chapter.",
