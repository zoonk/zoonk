Also, the chapter description doesn’t explicitly call for subject pronouns; they’re supportive but somewhat scope-expanding compared to the stated focus on conjugations and key irregulars.",

Finally, ensure no lesson exceeds 8 concepts (currently compliant) while possibly splitting the “present tense meanings” vs “ir a + inf” duplication (it appears both under meanings and under ir lesson) by keeping it in one most-relevant place to fully satisfy the ‘no duplicates’ rule.",
