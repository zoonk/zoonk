The lessons 'Yo Spelling Change: -car to -qu', 'Yo Spelling Change: -gar to -gu', and 'Yo Spelling Change: -zar to -c' describe orthographic changes that occur in the Preterite tense (e.g., *busqué*, *pagué*), not the Present tense (e.g., *busco*, *pago*). Teaching that 'sacar' becomes 'saquo' or 'pagar' becomes 'pague' in the present tense is a major factual error.",

Adding lessons for 'Sokuon: Small Tsu' would make this perfect for real-world application, though their absence is technically compliant with the strict text of the provided description.",
