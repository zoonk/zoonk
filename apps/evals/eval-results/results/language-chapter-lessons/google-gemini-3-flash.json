It broke down regular verbs into 6 separate lessons (one per ending), which is excellent, but lumped 5-6 pronouns into single lessons ('Subject Pronouns: Singular') and lumped 6 irregular forms into single lessons ('Irregular Verb: Ser'). Additionally, the prompt's 'Good Title Examples' explicitly listed 'Subject Pronoun: I' and 'Subject Pronoun: You (Informal)', suggesting a level of granularity for pronouns that the model ignored. Finally, the model included 'Vosotros' lessons despite the instructions specifying a preference for Latin American Spanish (where Vosotros is not used), though it did correctly label them as being for Spain.",

It should also consider splitting the irregular verbs (e.g., 'Ser: Singular Forms', 'Ser: Plural Forms') to match the high granularity established with the regular verbs. Removing the 'Vosotros' lessons would better align with the Latin American Spanish locale preference.",
