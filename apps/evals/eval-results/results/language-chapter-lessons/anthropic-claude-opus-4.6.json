The lesson 'Daily Routine Verbs: -er and -ir Group' violates this by combining two verb groups. \n2. Pedagogical Gap: The final section introduces reflexive verbs (e.g., 'despertarse', 'levantarse') in the 'Daily Routine Verbs' lessons. However, there is no preceding lesson explaining *what* reflexive verbs are or *how* to conjugate the reflexive pronouns (me, te, se, etc.). A student following this progression would be unable to conjugate these correctly based solely on the previous 'Subject Pronoun' and standard conjugation lessons.",
