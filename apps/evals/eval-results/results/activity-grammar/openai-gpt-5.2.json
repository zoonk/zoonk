        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE: Latin American Spanish output required (NOT English).\n\nTOPIC: Korean subject markers 이 (i) and 가 (ga) - particles that mark the subject of a sentence.\n\nSCRIPT: Non-Roman (romanization MUST be included)\n\nGRAMMAR PATTERN: Korean uses 이 after consonant-ending nouns and 가 after vowel-ending nouns to mark the grammatical subject. The choice depends on the final sound of the noun.\n\nROMANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- MUST include romanization for all Korean text\n- Standard romanization system (Revised Romanization or similar)\n\nACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize SEVERELY if:\n- Output is in English instead of Spanish\n- 이/가 usage does not match the consonant/vowel rule\n- Examples do not clearly demonstrate when to use each marker\n- Romanization is missing or incorrect\n- Discovery question tests vocabulary instead of subject marker selection\n- Exercises have markers that do not follow the consonant/vowel pattern\n\nEXERCISE TEMPLATE FORMAT - Penalize SEVERELY if:\n- Exercise templates include romanization in parentheses after the Korean text\n  BAD: \"학생[BLANK]공부해요. (haksaeng [BLANK] gongbuhaeyo.)\"\n  GOOD: \"학생[BLANK]공부해요.\"\n- Templates should contain ONLY Korean script and the [BLANK] placeholder\n- Romanization belongs in the romanization field of examples, NOT in exercise templates\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. STRUCTURE - PATTERN DISCOVERY FORMAT (CRITICAL):\n   The activity MUST follow the Pattern Discovery structure:\n   - 3-4 examples demonstrating the grammar pattern\n   - 1 discovery question with exactly 4 options (exactly 1 correct)\n   - Brief rule summary (maximum 2 sentences)\n   - 2-3 fill-in-the-blank exercises\n   Penalize SEVERELY if any structural element is missing or malformed.\n\n2. EXAMPLES QUALITY:\n   - Each example MUST demonstrate the target grammar pattern\n   - The highlight field MUST isolate the grammar element being taught\n   - Examples should make the pattern discoverable WITHOUT explicit explanation\n   - Translations MUST be accurate and natural in the output language\n   - Sentences should be simple enough for learners to focus on the pattern\n   - Penalize if examples are unrelated to the grammar pattern or too complex\n\n3. DISCOVERY QUESTION:\n   - MUST test pattern recognition, NOT memorization\n   - MUST have exactly 4 options\n   - MUST have exactly 1 correct option (isCorrect: true)\n   - ALL options MUST have feedback explaining why they are correct/incorrect\n   - Distractors should be plausible observations a learner might make\n   - Penalize if the question tests vocabulary instead of grammar understanding\n\n4. RULE SUMMARY:\n   - MUST be maximum 2 sentences\n   - MUST confirm what was discoverable from the examples\n   - Use clear, simple language accessible to learners\n   - Should NOT introduce new information not demonstrated in examples\n   - Penalize if verbose, unclear, or contradicts the examples\n\n5. EXERCISES - FILL-IN-THE-BLANK:\n   - Each exercise MUST have exactly one [BLANK] placeholder\n   - MUST test the same grammar pattern taught in examples\n   - The answers array MUST contain the correct answer(s)\n   - Distractors MUST be plausible wrong answers testing common mistakes\n   - Feedback MUST explain why the correct answer fits the pattern\n   - Penalize if exercises test different grammar or have unclear blanks\n   - **CRITICAL**: Exercise templates must contain ONLY target language text and [BLANK].\n     Do NOT include romanization/transliteration in parentheses after templates.\n     BAD: \"さくらさん[BLANK]先生です。(Sakura-san [BLANK] sensei desu.)\"\n     GOOD: \"さくらさん[BLANK]先生です。\"\n     Penalize SEVERELY if templates include romanization in any form.\n\n6. ROMANIZATION (CRITICAL):\n   - For non-Roman scripts (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.):\n     romanization MUST be included and accurate using standard systems (romaji, romanization, pinyin, etc.)\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, etc.):\n     romanization MUST be empty string \"\"\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization contains text for Roman scripts\n\n7. LINGUISTIC ACCURACY (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - ALL sentences must be grammatically correct in the target language\n   - ALL translations must be accurate and natural in the output language\n   - Grammar explanations must be linguistically correct\n   - The grammar pattern described must match what is actually demonstrated\n   - Penalize SEVERELY for incorrect grammar or mistranslations\n\n8. PEDAGOGICAL QUALITY:\n   - Examples should progress from simple to slightly more complex\n   - The discovery question should lead learners to the correct insight\n   - Exercises should reinforce the discovered pattern\n   - Content should be appropriate for language learners\n   - Penalize if content is confusing, misleading, or pedagogically unsound\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific example sentences - accept ANY valid sentences demonstrating the pattern\n- Do NOT penalize for specific vocabulary choices\n- Do NOT require specific phrases or sentence structures\n- Do NOT penalize for different valid approaches to explaining the grammar point\n- FOCUS ON: structural correctness, linguistic accuracy, pattern clarity, romanization correctness\n- Different valid teaching approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- The eval model should judge whether the output teaches the pattern effectively, not whether it matches a predetermined answer\n\n    ",
