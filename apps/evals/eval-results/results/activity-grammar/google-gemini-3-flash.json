While the examples and some exercises are identical to the example provided in the prompt instructions, this is largely due to the specific request matching the example topic exactly, and the model did generate unique discovery distractors and an additional exercise.",

EXAMPLES QUALITY:\n   - Each example MUST demonstrate the target grammar pattern\n   - The highlight field MUST isolate the grammar element being taught\n   - Examples should make the pattern discoverable WITHOUT explicit explanation\n   - Translations MUST be accurate and natural in the output language\n   - Sentences should be simple enough for learners to focus on the pattern\n   - Penalize if examples are unrelated to the grammar pattern or too complex\n\n3. DISCOVERY QUESTION:\n   - MUST test pattern recognition, NOT memorization\n   - MUST have exactly 4 options\n   - MUST have exactly 1 correct option (isCorrect: true)\n   - ALL options MUST have feedback explaining why they are correct/incorrect\n   - Distractors should be plausible observations a learner might make\n   - Penalize if the question tests vocabulary instead of grammar understanding\n\n4. RULE SUMMARY:\n   - MUST be maximum 2 sentences\n   - MUST confirm what was discoverable from the examples\n   - Use clear, simple language accessible to learners\n   - Should NOT introduce new information not demonstrated in examples\n   - Penalize if verbose, unclear, or contradicts the examples\n\n5. EXERCISES - FILL-IN-THE-BLANK:\n   - Each exercise MUST have exactly one [BLANK] placeholder\n   - MUST test the same grammar pattern taught in examples\n   - The answers array MUST contain the correct answer(s)\n   - Distractors MUST be plausible wrong answers testing common mistakes\n   - Feedback MUST explain why the correct answer fits the pattern\n   - Penalize if exercises test different grammar or have unclear blanks\n   - **CRITICAL**: Exercise templates must contain ONLY target language text and [BLANK].\n     Do NOT include romanization/transliteration in parentheses after templates.\n     BAD: \"さくらさん[BLANK]先生です。(Sakura-san [BLANK] sensei desu.)\"\n     GOOD: \"さくらさん[BLANK]先生です。\"\n     Penalize SEVERELY if templates include romanization in any form.\n\n6. ROMANIZATION (CRITICAL):\n   - For non-Roman scripts (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.):\n     romanization MUST be included and accurate using standard systems (romaji, romanization, pinyin, etc.)\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, etc.):\n     romanization MUST be empty string \"\"\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization contains text for Roman scripts\n\n7. LINGUISTIC ACCURACY (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - ALL sentences must be grammatically correct in the target language\n   - ALL translations must be accurate and natural in the output language\n   - Grammar explanations must be linguistically correct\n   - The grammar pattern described must match what is actually demonstrated\n   - Penalize SEVERELY for incorrect grammar or mistranslations\n\n8. PEDAGOGICAL QUALITY:\n   - Examples should progress from simple to slightly more complex\n   - The discovery question should lead learners to the correct insight\n   - Exercises should reinforce the discovered pattern\n   - Content should be appropriate for language learners\n   - Penalize if content is confusing, misleading, or pedagogically unsound\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific example sentences - accept ANY valid sentences demonstrating the pattern\n- Do NOT penalize for specific vocabulary choices\n- Do NOT require specific phrases or sentence structures\n- Do NOT penalize for different valid approaches to explaining the grammar point\n- FOCUS ON: structural correctness, linguistic accuracy, pattern clarity, romanization correctness\n- Different valid teaching approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- The eval model should judge whether the output teaches the pattern effectively, not whether it matches a predetermined answer\n\n    ",
