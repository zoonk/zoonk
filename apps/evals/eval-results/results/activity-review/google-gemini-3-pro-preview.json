It strictly adheres to the 'no-memorization' philosophy by using metaphors and novel scenarios (e.g., the ship's captain logbook for Write-Ahead Logging is a perfect analogy). The feedback is conversational and educational ('Bingo!', 'Spot on!'). The questions cover all dimensions: WHY (history/risk), WHAT (ACID definitions), HOW (locking, logs, rollbacks), and trade-offs (isolation levels). While Q8 (Airlines) and Q11 (Social Media) touch on domains mentioned in the input, they test specific mechanics (locking behavior and eventual consistency/isolation trade-offs) rather than recalling the input text, which is an acceptable and effective use of those contexts.",

TRANSFER CHECK: The inputs discuss banking transfers, inventory systems, and specific examples. Questions must use completely different scenarios (e.g., airline reservations, multiplayer games, collaborative editing) to test the same concepts.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHECK: Look for questions that connect WHY transactions exist (data integrity problems) with HOW they work (locking, logging) and WHERE they apply (novel systems).\n\n4.

Questions must use completely different scenarios (e.g., workplace dynamics, online communities, family decisions) to test the same concepts.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHECK: Look for questions that connect WHY conformity exists (evolutionary benefits, social acceptance) with HOW social pressure operates (unanimity, authority) and WHERE these dynamics appear in modern life.\n\n4. MISCONCEPTION CHECK: Distractors should include common psychology misconceptions like:\n   - Thinking conformity only affects weak-willed people\n   - Believing obedience experiments wouldn't replicate today\n   - Confusing descriptive norms with injunctive norms\n   - Underestimating situational power over personality\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\nSEVERITY GUIDE - Use this to calibrate your scoring:\n\nSEVERE ISSUES (heavy penalty):\n- Factual errors or hallucination (inventing facts not in the input)\n- Testing pure memorization (\"What metaphor did the text use?\")\n- Questions that reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" or similar meta-language\n- Wrong tone (stiff, academic, exam-like instead of conversational)\n- Format violations (wrong question count, missing fields, multiple correct answers)\n- Distractors that are obviously absurd or unrelated\n- Language purity violations (mixing languages)\n\nMODERATE ISSUES (medium penalty):\n- Coverage heavily skewed to one content type (e.g., 15 HOW questions, 0 WHY)\n- No integration questions connecting multiple content types\n- Feedback that just says \"correct/incorrect\" without insight\n- Questions answerable without understanding (too easy)\n\nMINOR ISSUES (light penalty or just note):\n- Reusing a scenario from the input (not ideal, but okay if the question still tests understanding)\n- Some questions slightly easier than others\n- Feedback could be friendlier but is still helpful\n- Minor missed opportunities for deeper insight\n\n1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Questions must be factually correct. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions contain factual errors or hallucinated information\n   - Correct answers are actually wrong based on the input content\n   - Feedback explains concepts incorrectly\n\n2. UNDERSTANDING VS MEMORIZATION: Questions must test thinking, not recall. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions ask \"What did the text say?\" or \"Which example was used?\"\n   - Questions reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" \"according to the text\"\n   - Questions can be answered by pattern-matching phrases from the input\n\n3. TONE & STYLE: Must feel conversational and friendly. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Language is stiff, formal, or exam-like\n   - Feedback sounds academic or preachy\n   - Questions use unexplained jargon\n\n4.

SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Question count outside 15-20 range\n   - Missing required fields or wrong types\n   - Multiple correct answers per question\n   - Character limits exceeded\n\n5. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: Wrong answers must be plausible. Penalize if:\n   - Distractors are obviously absurd or unrelated\n   - The correct answer is obvious without understanding\n   - Distractors don't represent real misconceptions\n\n6.

SCENARIO FRESHNESS (MINOR): Prefer novel scenarios, but don't heavily penalize reuse.\n   - Ideal: Questions use fresh scenarios not in the input\n   - Acceptable: Reusing input scenarios IF the question still tests understanding\n   - Only penalize if reused scenario makes the question pure recall\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT heavily penalize scenario reuse if the question still tests understanding\n- Do NOT require specific concepts to be tested by name\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" set of questions\n- FOCUS penalties on: factual errors, memorization-based questions, wrong tone, format violations\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
