Penalize if:\n   - ACID properties are incorrectly described or conflated\n   - Isolation levels are misrepresented (e.g., claiming serializable has no overhead)\n   - Deadlock causes or prevention strategies are wrong\n   - Atomicity is confused with durability\n\n2. TRANSFER CHECK: The inputs discuss banking transfers, inventory systems, and specific examples. Questions must use completely different scenarios (e.g., airline reservations, multiplayer games, collaborative editing) to test the same concepts.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHECK: Look for questions that connect WHY transactions exist (data integrity problems) with HOW they work (locking, logging) and WHERE they apply (novel systems).\n\n4. MISCONCEPTION CHECK: Distractors should include common database misconceptions like:\n   - Thinking transactions automatically prevent all data issues\n   - Confusing isolation with atomicity\n   - Believing higher isolation levels are always better\n   - Misunderstanding when locks are acquired vs released\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\nSEVERITY GUIDE - Use this to calibrate your scoring:\n\nSEVERE ISSUES (heavy penalty):\n- Factual errors or hallucination (inventing facts not in the input)\n- Testing pure memorization (\"What metaphor did the text use?\")\n- Questions that reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" or similar meta-language\n- Wrong tone (stiff, academic, exam-like instead of conversational)\n- Format violations (wrong question count, missing fields, multiple correct answers)\n- Distractors that are obviously absurd or unrelated\n- Language purity violations (mixing languages)\n\nMODERATE ISSUES (medium penalty):\n- Coverage heavily skewed to one content type (e.g., 15 HOW questions, 0 WHY)\n- No integration questions connecting multiple content types\n- Feedback that just says \"correct/incorrect\" without insight\n- Questions answerable without understanding (too easy)\n\nMINOR ISSUES (light penalty or just note):\n- Reusing a scenario from the input (not ideal, but okay if the question still tests understanding)\n- Some questions slightly easier than others\n- Feedback could be friendlier but is still helpful\n- Minor missed opportunities for deeper insight\n\n1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Questions must be factually correct. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions contain factual errors or hallucinated information\n   - Correct answers are actually wrong based on the input content\n   - Feedback explains concepts incorrectly\n\n2. UNDERSTANDING VS MEMORIZATION: Questions must test thinking, not recall. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions ask \"What did the text say?\" or \"Which example was used?\"\n   - Questions reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" \"according to the text\"\n   - Questions can be answered by pattern-matching phrases from the input\n\n3. TONE & STYLE: Must feel conversational and friendly. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Language is stiff, formal, or exam-like\n   - Feedback sounds academic or preachy\n   - Questions use unexplained jargon\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Must meet structural requirements. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Question count outside 15-20 range\n   - Missing required fields or wrong types\n   - Multiple correct answers per question\n   - Character limits exceeded\n\n5. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: Wrong answers must be plausible. Penalize if:\n   - Distractors are obviously absurd or unrelated\n   - The correct answer is obvious without understanding\n   - Distractors don't represent real misconceptions\n\n6. CONTENT COVERAGE: Should test across content types. Penalize if:\n   - Any content type (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHERE) is completely missing\n   - Coverage is heavily skewed\n\n7. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Should guide learning. Penalize if:\n   - Feedback just says \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" without insight\n   - Wrong answer feedback doesn't point toward the correct answer\n\n8. SCENARIO FRESHNESS (MINOR): Prefer novel scenarios, but don't heavily penalize reuse.\n   - Ideal: Questions use fresh scenarios not in the input\n   - Acceptable: Reusing input scenarios IF the question still tests understanding\n   - Only penalize if reused scenario makes the question pure recall\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT heavily penalize scenario reuse if the question still tests understanding\n- Do NOT require specific concepts to be tested by name\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" set of questions\n- FOCUS penalties on: factual errors, memorization-based questions, wrong tone, format violations\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

TONE & STYLE: Must feel conversational and friendly. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Language is stiff, formal, or exam-like\n   - Feedback sounds academic or preachy\n   - Questions use unexplained jargon\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Must meet structural requirements. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Question count outside 15-20 range\n   - Missing required fields or wrong types\n   - Multiple correct answers per question\n   - Character limits exceeded\n\n5. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: Wrong answers must be plausible. Penalize if:\n   - Distractors are obviously absurd or unrelated\n   - The correct answer is obvious without understanding\n   - Distractors don't represent real misconceptions\n\n6. CONTENT COVERAGE: Should test across content types. Penalize if:\n   - Any content type (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHERE) is completely missing\n   - Coverage is heavily skewed\n\n7. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Should guide learning. Penalize if:\n   - Feedback just says \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" without insight\n   - Wrong answer feedback doesn't point toward the correct answer\n\n8. SCENARIO FRESHNESS (MINOR): Prefer novel scenarios, but don't heavily penalize reuse.\n   - Ideal: Questions use fresh scenarios not in the input\n   - Acceptable: Reusing input scenarios IF the question still tests understanding\n   - Only penalize if reused scenario makes the question pure recall\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT heavily penalize scenario reuse if the question still tests understanding\n- Do NOT require specific concepts to be tested by name\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" set of questions\n- FOCUS penalties on: factual errors, memorization-based questions, wrong tone, format violations\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
