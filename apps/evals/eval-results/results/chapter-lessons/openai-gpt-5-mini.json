Additionally, there are instances of redundancy used to pad the list: Lesson 21 ('Presunção iuris et de iure') and Lesson 25 ('Presunção que exclui prova em contrário') cover the exact same legal concept. Lesson 24 ('Presunções legais') is an umbrella term for concepts already broken down in 20 and 21. Lessons 6 and 36 also heavily overlap ('convicção motivada' and 'livre convencimento motivado').",
