The descriptions occasionally use phrases like 'Entendimento básico' (Basic understanding) or 'Conhecimentos fundamentais' (Fundamental knowledge). While the prompt forbids 'basics of' or 'understand', these are used here as noun phrases to describe the specific competency being listed (e.g., 'the competency of having a basic understanding'), rather than as fluffy learning objectives (e.g., 'In this lesson you will understand...'). Therefore, this is not considered a violation of the negative constraints. The term 'Follow-up' in Lesson 41 is an Anglicism commonly used in Brazilian corporate contexts, though 'Acompanhamento' would be the native equivalent; this is acceptable given the context.",
