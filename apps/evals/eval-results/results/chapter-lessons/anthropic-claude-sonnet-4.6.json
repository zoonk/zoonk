Several titles contain these prohibited connectors, including: 'Verdade formal x verdade material', 'Standards de prova e risco de erro judicial', 'Ônus subjetivo x ônus objetivo da prova', 'Inversão x facilitação do ônus da prova', 'Presunção legal x presunção judicial', 'Presunções e ônus da prova', 'Indícios e sua relação com presunções', 'Probabilidade estatística x suficiência probatória', 'O Paradoxo do Ônibus e os limites da prova estatística', 'Prova estatística e standards de prova', 'Direito à contraprova e contraditório', and 'Prova ilícita e sua inadmissibilidade'.
