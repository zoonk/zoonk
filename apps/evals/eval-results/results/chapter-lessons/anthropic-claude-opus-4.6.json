First, it completely ignores the strict negative constraint to NEVER use 'AND' (or 'e' in Portuguese) to combine concepts in a title. At least 13 titles use 'e' to combine concepts (e.g., 'Provas típicas e provas atípicas', 'Objeto da prova e tema da prova', 'Indícios e presunções', 'Inversão judicial e inversão legal do ônus'), which means the AI failed to break them down into single-concept lessons. Second, it violates the explicit negative expectation 'Should NOT cover precedent analysis or jurisprudence' by including the lesson 'Prova estatística na jurisprudência brasileira'.",
