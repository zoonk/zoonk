The prompt explicitly asks to break down broad topics, notes that complex topics usually require over 100 lessons, and insists that each lesson must be learnable in 2-3 minutes (10 tweets max). However, the AI provided only 31 lessons, many of which cover massive historical periods or vast structural concepts that cannot be adequately explained in 2-3 minutes. Examples of overly broad lessons include 'The Military Regime' (covers a 21-year dictatorship), 'The Oligarchic Republic' (covers 40 years), 'The Evolution of Taxation', and 'Centralization During the Empire'. These violate the 'single-concept focus' constraint.",
