          "conclusion": "A significant section of the lessons (approximately lessons 9-28, covering technical skills like 'Machine Learning aplicado', 'Programação em Python', 'fMRI: fundamentos práticos') is too broad for the specified constraints. The instructions require each lesson to be explainable in '10 short tweets' and learnable in '2-3 minutes'. Topics like mastering EEG montage, training ML models, or structuring Python pipelines cannot be realistically taught or explained in such a short format. These subjects would typically require entire chapters or courses. While they address the 'Core Competencies' requirement, their granularity is inappropriate for single micro-lessons.",

Instead of attempting to teach the skill (e.g., 'Understand BOLD signal'), the lessons should focus on the professional application or portfolio demonstration of the skill (e.g., 'Demonstrating fMRI Proficiency in a Portfolio' or 'Key Python Libraries for Neuroscientists'). This would align better with the 2-3 minute constraint and the chapter's goal.",
