Ensure the TCP-vs-UDP comparison requirement is explicitly met in titles without relying on a whole lesson implicitly (could add concepts like \"TCP reliability guarantee\" and \"UDP best-effort delivery\" already present, but the selection lesson could be renamed to avoid implying only TCP). Optionally add missing practical items strongly aligned with the chapter description’s debugging goal: \"ARP\" (if staying at L2/L3 boundary), \"Duplex mismatch\" is too physical, but \"MTU black hole\" as a concrete failure mode, and \"ICMP rate limiting\" as a traceroute/ping pitfall.

Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",
