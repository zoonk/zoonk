(2) A few lessons are slightly multi-concept in practice (e.g., \"Sources of Latency\" covers distance, hops, speed-of-light, and queuing; \"Slow Connections\" bundles several causes). (3) The chapter description mentions \"routing\" broadly but there’s no explicit lesson on \"Routing vs switching\"; switching is introduced, but the boundary concept isn’t explicitly isolated. These are minor because the overall set remains usable and mostly compliant.",

(2) Split a few bundled failure/latency lessons into narrower ones (propagation delay vs queuing delay; congestion vs bufferbloat; \"slow but not down\" into distinct symptoms). (3) Add a couple more concrete failure modes explicitly: misconfigured subnet mask, duplicate IP, gateway ARP failure, MTU mismatch on VPN specifically, ICMP blocked as a failure amplifier (separate from general ICMP role). (4) Add one or two explicit mental-model lessons mapping symptoms to OSI layers (e.g., \"Ping works, TCP fails\" as a generic pattern) to align with \"practical mental models\" goal. These are improvements, not blockers.",

However, there are concrete scope violations with neighboring chapters: multiple lessons are primarily about urbanization/urban reform dynamics rather than health mechanisms (e.g., “Urban sanitation infrastructure,” “Urban reform as a health risk,” “Urban growth as health pressure”). While sanitation is in-scope, these drift toward urban policy/infrastructure as the main subject rather than health systems/epidemiology; at least “Urban sanitation infrastructure” substantially overlaps the neighboring chapter explicitly covering sanitation. (2) Some lessons are too broad to fit the single-concept / 10-tweets constraint, e.g., “Health policy under dictatorship,” “HIV/AIDS policy model,” “COVID-19 governance conflicts,” “Medicines policy,” each bundles multiple mechanisms and subtopics that would require further splitting; this is a core requirement breach because granularity is central. (3) Coverage is not consistently separated as requested: public health policy vs biomedical politics are mixed in places (e.g., “Vaccination as state policy,” “Biomedical authority in politics,” “Protocols as political instruments” are ok, but other policy lessons embed biomedical politics and vice versa). These issues materially reduce compliance with the prompt’s most important constraints (single-concept focus and neighboring-chapter boundaries).",

(3) Periodization is uneven: early 20th-century epidemics beyond smallpox/yellow fever (e.g., 1918 influenza) are missing, and some disease-specific threads (cholera) are absent; this is a completeness/granularity gap but not necessarily fatal given the broad time span.

(2) Reframe or remove lessons that substantially teach neighboring-chapter topics; keep sanitation/infrastructure only when framed as a health mechanism (waterborne transmission, vector habitat, outbreak correlation) rather than urban policy. (3) Add missing major epidemics and campaign nodes explicitly mentioned/implicit in scope: 1918 influenza in Brazil, yellow fever specifics, cholera waves, polio vaccination campaigns, meningitis outbreak under dictatorship, etc., each as its own single-concept lesson.
