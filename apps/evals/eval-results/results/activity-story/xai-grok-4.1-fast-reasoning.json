In Scene 7, the twist reveals the cycle is *inverted* (heating the chamber, cooling the environment).

If R=3 and the minority has only 2 nodes, reads should fail (unavailable), not return stale data. If the partition healed and a read of 3 nodes occurred (Scene 7), the overlap with the write quorum (W=3) guarantees seeing the latest write (pigeonhole principle).

For an open box with V=10, the optimal dimensions are l=w≈2.71 and h≈1.36 (Area ≈ 22.1). The text states l≈2.51, h≈1.59, and Area ≈ 30.5. Furthermore, the text claims this area (30.5) is 'worse than cylindrical' (which was ~25.7), whereas the correct optimal open box area (22.1) is actually better (smaller) than the closed cylinder. This factual error in the conclusion misrepresents the optimization result.",

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in Spanish.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Calculus optimization concepts must be mathematically correct. Penalize if:\n   - Critical points are confused with extrema\n   - Second derivative test is misapplied\n   - Constraint optimization (Lagrange multipliers) is incorrectly described\n\n2. SCENARIO CHECK: The workplace problem should involve realistic optimization challenges like: minimizing costs, maximizing efficiency, resource allocation, or engineering design constraints.\n\n3. CONCEPTUAL FOCUS: Decisions should require reasoning about when and how to apply optimization techniques.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. STORY AUTHENTICITY: Dialogue must be pure conversation between colleagues with no narrator text, no character name prefixes (like \"Sarah:\"), and no action descriptions. The learner should feel immersed in a real workplace conversation.\n\n2. EDUCATIONAL ALIGNMENT: Every decision point must require applying lesson concepts through reasoning, not memorizing facts. Wrong options should be plausible but flawed for specific conceptual reasons.\n\n3. PLOT COHERENCE: Scenes must flow naturally as a continuous story where each scene builds from the previous dialogue. The second-to-last scene MUST introduce a genuine plot twist (surprise, complication, or revelation). The final scene must resolve the problem AND reinforce the main learning takeaway.\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - context: Maximum 500 characters of pure dialogue\n   - question: Maximum 100 characters\n   - options: Exactly 4 objects, each with: text (max 50 chars), isCorrect (boolean), feedback (max 300 chars)\n   - Exactly 1 option must have isCorrect: true, the other 3 must have isCorrect: false\n\n5. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in dialogue to personalize the experience.\n\n6. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Each option must have feedback explaining WHY it's right (with insight) or WHY it's wrong (and what would be correct). Feedback should help learners understand the reasoning, not just state correctness.\n\n7. SCENE COUNT: Story must have between 7 and 20 scenes. Let problem complexity dictate length.\n\n8. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: All wrong options must be plausible choices someone might consider. Penalize obviously silly or absurd options that no reasonable person would choose.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific plot choices, character names, or scenario settings you might expect\n- Do NOT require specific scenes like \"investigation\" or \"resolution\" by name - focus on whether the story has good flow\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"ideal\" story structure\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, narrator/description text in dialogue, decisions that test memorization instead of reasoning, missing plot twist, poor distractor quality, or factually incorrect lesson application\n- Different valid story approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
