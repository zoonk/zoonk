Feedback should help learners understand the reasoning, not just state correctness.\n\n7. SCENE COUNT: Story must have between 7 and 20 scenes. Let problem complexity dictate length.\n\n8. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: All wrong options must be plausible choices someone might consider. Penalize obviously silly or absurd options that no reasonable person would choose.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific plot choices, character names, or scenario settings you might expect\n- Do NOT require specific scenes like \"investigation\" or \"resolution\" by name - focus on whether the story has good flow\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"ideal\" story structure\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, narrator/description text in dialogue, decisions that test memorization instead of reasoning, missing plot twist, poor distractor quality, or factually incorrect lesson application\n- Different valid story approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
