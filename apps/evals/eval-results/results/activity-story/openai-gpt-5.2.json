SCENARIO CHECK: The workplace problem should involve realistic TypeScript challenges like: refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript, debugging type errors, designing type-safe APIs, or handling third-party library types.\n\n3. CONCEPTUAL FOCUS: Decisions should require reasoning about type safety trade-offs, not just recall of syntax.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. STORY AUTHENTICITY: Dialogue must be pure conversation between colleagues with no narrator text, no character name prefixes (like \"Sarah:\"), and no action descriptions. The learner should feel immersed in a real workplace conversation.\n\n2. EDUCATIONAL ALIGNMENT: Every decision point must require applying lesson concepts through reasoning, not memorizing facts. Wrong options should be plausible but flawed for specific conceptual reasons.\n\n3.
