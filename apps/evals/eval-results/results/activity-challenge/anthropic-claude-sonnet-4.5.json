        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in Spanish.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Energy conservation principles must be physically accurate. Penalize if:\n   - Energy transformations violate conservation laws in consequences\n   - Efficiency concepts are misrepresented\n   - Entropy/waste heat considerations are ignored\n\n2. DIMENSION CHECK: Dimensions should represent meaningful energy system concerns like:\n   - Energy Output, System Efficiency, Environmental Impact, Operational Reliability\n   - Should reflect the interconnected nature of energy systems\n\n3. SCENARIO CHECK: The challenge should involve realistic energy system decisions.\n\n4. CONSEQUENCE CHECK: Consequences should explain the physical impact of energy choices.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. DIMENSION QUALITY: Dimension names used across all effects should:\n   - Connect meaningfully to lesson concepts (2-4 unique dimensions total)\n   - Create natural tension (trade-off axes)\n   - Be consistently named across all effects (same concept = same name)\n\n2. CONSEQUENCE QUALITY: Each option's consequence must:\n   - Explain what happens as a result of the choice\n   - Connect to lesson concepts (not generic outcomes)\n   - Teach something about trade-offs\n   - Be consistent with the stated effects (if effect is positive for dimension X, consequence should reflect improvement in X)\n\n3. TRADE-OFF DESIGN: No option should be obviously best. Options should affect multiple dimensions with mixed impacts (e.g., positive for one, negative for another). If one option has all positive effects, penalize.\n\n4. EFFECTS CONSISTENCY: Each option should have 1-3 effects. Dimension names should be reused consistently across options to create meaningful trade-offs (not random unique names for each effect).\n\n5. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - intro: Maximum 500 characters\n   - steps: 4-6 steps, each with context (max 500 chars), question (max 100 chars), and 3-4 options\n   - options: Each with text (max 80 chars), consequence (max 300 chars), effects array (1-3 items with dimension and impact)\n   - reflection: Maximum 500 characters\n\n6. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in intro and dialogue.\n\n7. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Consequences and effects must make sense given the lesson content. If the lesson teaches that X leads to Y, effects should reflect this.\n\n8. DIALOGUE QUALITY: Context must be pure conversation with NO narrator text, NO character name prefixes, NO action descriptions.\n\n9. REFLECTION QUALITY: The reflection must tie the experience back to lesson principles and acknowledge that different approaches have merit.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific scenario choices or dimension names\n- Do NOT require specific dimensions by name\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, consequences that don't connect to lesson concepts, obviously dominant options, inconsistent dimension naming, narrator text in dialogue\n- Different valid challenge designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
