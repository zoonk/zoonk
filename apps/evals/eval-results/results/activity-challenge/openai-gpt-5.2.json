Physically, active cooling (HVAC) consumes energy (auxiliary load) and does not reduce the amount of energy converted to waste heat by the source; it merely manages the temperature. Reducing the 'Energy Lost' variable here implies a gain in conversion efficiency or reduction in joules lost, which contradicts the physics of adding a cooling load (which usually increases total energy usage). The variable definition shifts from 'Joules Lost' to 'Temperature/Heat Accumulation' in this step, violating the 'Variable Definition Lock'.",

          "conclusion": "There are some potentially dominant options. In Step 2, Option 4 ('Almacenamiento mecánico') offers significantly better stats across Efficiency, Heat, and Budget compared to Option 1 ('Baterías grandes'), only sacrificing 3 points of Reliability. Given the magnitudes, Option 4 is almost always the better strategic choice. Similarly in Step 4, Option 1 ('Control inteligente') is likely dominant over Option 2 ('Enfriamiento') as it provides +6 Efficiency for only 2 more Budget cost, with similar Heat/Reliability impacts. Strengthening the unique benefits of the weaker options (e.g., higher Reliability boost for Batteries) would improve strategic balance.",

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in Spanish.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Energy conservation principles must be physically accurate. Penalize if:\n   - Energy transformations violate conservation laws\n   - Efficiency concepts are misrepresented\n   - Entropy/waste heat considerations are ignored\n\n2. INVENTORY CHECK: Variables should represent meaningful energy system metrics like:\n   - Energy output, efficiency rating, environmental impact, operating costs\n   - Should reflect the interconnected nature of energy systems\n\n3. SCENARIO CHECK: The challenge should involve realistic energy system decisions like: choosing energy sources, optimizing efficiency, or balancing output vs. sustainability.\n\n4. TRADE-OFF CHECK: Options should reflect genuine energy trade-offs — higher output vs. efficiency losses, renewable vs. reliability, cost vs. environmental impact, etc.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. INVENTORY DESIGN: Variables must connect meaningfully to lesson concepts. Each variable should represent something the learner studied. Names should be intuitive and values should start in a reasonable range (typically 40-70).\n\n2. TRADE-OFF QUALITY: Every option must have genuine trade-offs. No option should be obviously dominant across all variables. Improving one variable should plausibly affect others based on lesson principles.\n\n3. WIN CONDITION BALANCE: Win conditions must be achievable with strategic thinking but require understanding lesson concepts. Conditions should create strategic tension (meeting all should require careful planning). Each inventory item must have its own win conditions embedded.\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - intro: Maximum 500 characters\n   - inventory: 3-5 items, each with name, startValue, and winConditions array (1-2 conditions per item)\n   - winConditions (per item): Array with operator (gte/lte/gt/lt/eq) and value\n   - steps: 3-6 steps, each with context (max 500 chars), question (max 100 chars), and 3-4 options\n   - options: Each with text (max 80 chars), effects array, and feedback (max 300 chars)\n\n5. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Each option's feedback must explain WHY the effects occur, connecting to lesson concepts. Feedback should help learners understand the reasoning behind trade-offs.\n\n6. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in intro and dialogue to personalize the experience.\n\n7. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Effects must make sense given the lesson content. If the lesson teaches that X leads to Y, the effects should reflect this relationship.\n\n8. DIALOGUE QUALITY: Context must be pure conversation with NO narrator text, NO character name prefixes, NO action descriptions. Should feel like colleagues working through a problem.\n\n9. EFFECT DESIGN: Effects should use realistic magnitudes (typically 5-20 points). Dramatic swings (30+) should be rare and justified.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific scenario choices or variable names\n- Do NOT require specific inventory variables by name\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, dominant options with no trade-offs, effects that contradict lesson concepts, narrator/description text in dialogue, or unachievable win conditions\n- Different valid challenge designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
