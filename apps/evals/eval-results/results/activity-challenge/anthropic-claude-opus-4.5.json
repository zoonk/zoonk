The instructions require using '2-4 different dimension names across all effects' and explicitly state 'dimensions must be consistent across all steps'. The AI used 6 distinct dimensions: Response Time, Memory Usage, Infrastructure Cost, Code Complexity, System Stability, and User Engagement. This creates inconsistent game mechanics.\n2. In Step 2, the narrative implies that Quicksort hitting its 'worst case' was triggered by data being 'reshuffled' (randomized) after being nearly sorted. Technically, random data is the ideal case for Quicksort (O(n log n)), while the worst case (O(n²)) is typically triggered by sorted/reverse-sorted data (in naive implementations) or specific 'killer' sequences. Randomization is the standard cure for Quicksort's worst case, so the narrative explanation is technically backwards.",

          "conclusion": "In Step 4, Option 3 (Propane), the consequence mentions 'avoiding investment' (CAPEX), but the effect is applied to 'Costos Operativos' (OPEX) as positive. While often conflated in simple models, typically retaining ICE vehicles implies lower CAPEX but higher OPEX (fuel/maintenance) compared to EVs. A dimension named 'Economía' or 'Costos Totales' might have been more precise, or the consequence could have focused on low fuel costs if that was the intent. Additionally, the consequences are somewhat textbook-descriptive; making them slightly more diegetic (e.g., 'The maintenance team reports...') would enhance the narrative immersion.",

        "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in Spanish.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Energy conservation principles must be physically accurate. Penalize if:\n   - Energy transformations violate conservation laws in consequences\n   - Efficiency concepts are misrepresented\n   - Entropy/waste heat considerations are ignored\n\n2. DIMENSION CHECK: Dimensions should represent meaningful energy system concerns like:\n   - Energy Output, System Efficiency, Environmental Impact, Operational Reliability\n   - Should reflect the interconnected nature of energy systems\n\n3. SCENARIO CHECK: The challenge should involve realistic energy system decisions.\n\n4. CONSEQUENCE CHECK: Consequences should explain the physical impact of energy choices.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. DIMENSION QUALITY: Dimension names used across all effects should:\n   - Connect meaningfully to lesson concepts (2-4 unique dimensions total)\n   - Create natural tension (trade-off axes)\n   - Be consistently named across all effects (same concept = same name)\n\n2. CONSEQUENCE QUALITY: Each option's consequence must:\n   - Explain what happens as a result of the choice\n   - Connect to lesson concepts (not generic outcomes)\n   - Teach something about trade-offs\n   - Be consistent with the stated effects (if effect is positive for dimension X, consequence should reflect improvement in X)\n\n3. TRADE-OFF DESIGN: No option should be obviously best. Options should affect multiple dimensions with mixed impacts (e.g., positive for one, negative for another). If one option has all positive effects, penalize.\n\n4. EFFECTS CONSISTENCY: Each option should have 1-3 effects. Dimension names should be reused consistently across options to create meaningful trade-offs (not random unique names for each effect).\n\n5. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - intro: Maximum 500 characters\n   - steps: 4-6 steps, each with context (max 500 chars), question (max 100 chars), and 3-4 options\n   - options: Each with text (max 80 chars), consequence (max 300 chars), effects array (1-3 items with dimension and impact)\n   - reflection: Maximum 500 characters\n\n6. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in intro and dialogue.\n\n7. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Consequences and effects must make sense given the lesson content. If the lesson teaches that X leads to Y, effects should reflect this.\n\n8. DIALOGUE QUALITY: Context must be pure conversation with NO narrator text, NO character name prefixes, NO action descriptions.\n\n9. REFLECTION QUALITY: The reflection must tie the experience back to lesson principles and acknowledge that different approaches have merit.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific scenario choices or dimension names\n- Do NOT require specific dimensions by name\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, consequences that don't connect to lesson concepts, obviously dominant options, inconsistent dimension naming, narrator text in dialogue\n- Different valid challenge designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
