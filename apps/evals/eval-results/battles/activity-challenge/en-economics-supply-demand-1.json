  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Supply and demand concepts must reflect genuine economics. Penalize if:\n   - Price elasticity effects are misrepresented in consequences\n   - Supply/demand dynamics are incorrectly described\n   - Market equilibrium concepts are misapplied\n\n2. DIMENSION CHECK: Dimensions should represent meaningful market concerns like:\n   - Revenue, Market Share, Customer Satisfaction, Profit Margins\n   - Should reflect the interconnected nature of market decisions\n\n3. SCENARIO CHECK: The challenge should involve realistic pricing and market decisions.\n\n4. CONSEQUENCE CHECK: Consequences should explain the market impact of pricing choices.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. DIMENSION QUALITY: Dimension names used across all effects should:\n   - Connect meaningfully to lesson concepts (2-4 unique dimensions total)\n   - Create natural tension (trade-off axes)\n   - Be consistently named across all effects (same concept = same name)\n\n2. CONSEQUENCE QUALITY: Each option's consequence must:\n   - Explain what happens as a result of the choice\n   - Connect to lesson concepts (not generic outcomes)\n   - Teach something about trade-offs\n   - Be consistent with the stated effects (if effect is positive for dimension X, consequence should reflect improvement in X)\n\n3. TRADE-OFF DESIGN: No option should be obviously best. Options should affect multiple dimensions with mixed impacts (e.g., positive for one, negative for another). If one option has all positive effects, penalize.\n\n4. EFFECTS CONSISTENCY: Each option should have 1-3 effects. Dimension names should be reused consistently across options to create meaningful trade-offs (not random unique names for each effect).\n\n5. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - intro: Maximum 500 characters\n   - steps: 4-6 steps, each with context (max 500 chars), question (max 100 chars), and 3-4 options\n   - options: Each with text (max 80 chars), consequence (max 300 chars), effects array (1-3 items with dimension and impact)\n   - reflection: Maximum 500 characters\n\n6. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in intro and dialogue.\n\n7. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Consequences and effects must make sense given the lesson content. If the lesson teaches that X leads to Y, effects should reflect this.\n\n8. DIALOGUE QUALITY: Context must be pure conversation with NO narrator text, NO character name prefixes, NO action descriptions.\n\n9. REFLECTION QUALITY: The reflection must tie the experience back to lesson principles and acknowledge that different approaches have merit.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific scenario choices or dimension names\n- Do NOT require specific dimensions by name\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, consequences that don't connect to lesson concepts, obviously dominant options, inconsistent dimension naming, narrator text in dialogue\n- Different valid challenge designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

Consequences are detailed, concept-connected (mentions elasticity, demand curves, market segmentation, equilibrium), and consistent with effects. Trade-offs are well-designed with no obviously dominant options - each choice involves mixed impacts. The 4-option format in each step adds depth. Format compliance is excellent with appropriate character limits. The reflection meaningfully ties back to supply/demand principles.
