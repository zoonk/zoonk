  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Ecosystem concepts must reflect genuine ecology. Penalize if:\n   - Trophic level interactions are misrepresented in consequences\n   - Carrying capacity concepts are incorrectly applied\n   - Biodiversity-stability relationships are oversimplified\n\n2. DIMENSION CHECK: Dimensions should represent meaningful ecological concerns like:\n   - Biodiversity, Ecosystem Stability, Resource Sustainability, Population Health\n   - Should reflect the interconnected nature of ecosystems\n\n3. SCENARIO CHECK: The challenge should involve realistic ecosystem management decisions.\n\n4. CONSEQUENCE CHECK: Consequences should explain the ecological impact of management choices.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. DIMENSION QUALITY: Dimension names used across all effects should:\n   - Connect meaningfully to lesson concepts (2-4 unique dimensions total)\n   - Create natural tension (trade-off axes)\n   - Be consistently named across all effects (same concept = same name)\n\n2. CONSEQUENCE QUALITY: Each option's consequence must:\n   - Explain what happens as a result of the choice\n   - Connect to lesson concepts (not generic outcomes)\n   - Teach something about trade-offs\n   - Be consistent with the stated effects (if effect is positive for dimension X, consequence should reflect improvement in X)\n\n3. TRADE-OFF DESIGN: No option should be obviously best. Options should affect multiple dimensions with mixed impacts (e.g., positive for one, negative for another). If one option has all positive effects, penalize.\n\n4. EFFECTS CONSISTENCY: Each option should have 1-3 effects. Dimension names should be reused consistently across options to create meaningful trade-offs (not random unique names for each effect).\n\n5. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - intro: Maximum 500 characters\n   - steps: 4-6 steps, each with context (max 500 chars), question (max 100 chars), and 3-4 options\n   - options: Each with text (max 80 chars), consequence (max 300 chars), effects array (1-3 items with dimension and impact)\n   - reflection: Maximum 500 characters\n\n6. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in intro and dialogue.\n\n7. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Consequences and effects must make sense given the lesson content. If the lesson teaches that X leads to Y, effects should reflect this.\n\n8. DIALOGUE QUALITY: Context must be pure conversation with NO narrator text, NO character name prefixes, NO action descriptions.\n\n9. REFLECTION QUALITY: The reflection must tie the experience back to lesson principles and acknowledge that different approaches have merit.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific scenario choices or dimension names\n- Do NOT require specific dimensions by name\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, consequences that don't connect to lesson concepts, obviously dominant options, inconsistent dimension naming, narrator text in dialogue\n- Different valid challenge designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

Dimensions used are: Ecosystem Health, Community Relations, Biodiversity, Budget, and Habitat Connectivity - these are meaningful and consistently applied across options.

The {{NAME}} placeholder is used appropriately throughout. All format constraints appear to be met. Minor weakness: some options have 3 effects which pushes the upper limit, and occasionally the consequences are quite long. The budget crisis step creates genuine difficult trade-offs with no obvious best choice. Excellent ecological accuracy throughout.",

Format compliance is good. The orchid scenario is creative and addresses real conservation dilemmas. Dialogue is clean without narrator text. The {{NAME}} placeholder is used well.
