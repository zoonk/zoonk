  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE: English output required for translations.\n\nTOPIC: French sentences for food and dining - using food-related vocabulary.\n\nSCRIPT: Roman (romanization should be empty string \"\")\n\nVOCABULARY WORDS PROVIDED: le pain, le fromage, le vin, la soupe, le dessert\nThese words MUST appear in the generated sentences.\n\nACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize SEVERELY if:\n- Any sentence doesn't use at least one of the provided vocabulary words\n- Food items are used in unrealistic contexts\n- Gender agreement is incorrect (le/la must match the noun)\n- Translations don't accurately convey the French meaning\n- Romanization contains any text (should be empty string)\n\nCONTEXT EXPECTATIONS:\n- Sentences about ordering, eating, or discussing food\n- Restaurant or home dining situations\n- Natural food-related conversations\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. VOCABULARY WORD USAGE (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - Each generated sentence MUST use at least one of the provided vocabulary words\n   - The words should be used in their natural form (conjugated verbs, declined nouns are acceptable)\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if sentences don't incorporate the provided vocabulary\n   - Penalize if words are used incorrectly or out of context\n\n2. TRANSLATION ACCURACY (CRITICAL):\n   - Each sentence-translation pair MUST be linguistically accurate\n   - The translation must convey the same meaning as the original sentence\n   - Consider regional variations (Brazilian Portuguese vs European, Latin American Spanish vs Castilian)\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if translations are incorrect, incomplete, or misleading\n   - Grammatical structures should be appropriately adapted between languages\n\n3. ROMANIZATION (required field):\n   - For Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.: romanization MUST contain the Roman letter representation of the sentence\n   - Use standard romanization systems (romaji for Japanese, pinyin for Chinese, etc.)\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.): romanization MUST be an empty string \"\"\n   - Penalize if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts or contains text for Roman scripts\n\n4. GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS:\n   - Sentences must be grammatically correct in the target language\n   - Verb conjugations must match the subject\n   - Gender agreement must be correct where applicable\n   - Word order should follow natural patterns of the target language\n   - Penalize for grammar errors, incorrect conjugations, or unnatural constructions\n\n5. SENTENCE NATURALNESS:\n   - Sentences should sound natural to native speakers\n   - Avoid overly literal translations or awkward phrasing\n   - Use appropriate register (formal/informal) for the context\n   - Penalize if sentences sound robotic, unnatural, or like machine translation\n\n6. CONTEXT DIVERSITY:\n   - Sentences should present different contexts or situations\n   - Avoid repetitive sentence structures\n   - Use variety in sentence types (statements, questions, commands where appropriate)\n   - Do NOT penalize for covering similar themes if vocabulary words naturally relate to each other\n\n7. LESSON RELEVANCE:\n   - Sentences should relate to the lesson topic\n   - The contexts should be appropriate for the lesson's educational goals\n   - Avoid straying into unrelated topics\n   - Do NOT require every sentence to explicitly reference the lesson topic - implicit relevance is fine\n\n8. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY:\n   - Sentences should be appropriate for language learners\n   - Avoid overly complex grammatical structures unless the lesson specifically targets advanced learners\n   - Vocabulary beyond the provided words should be at a similar or simpler level\n   - Penalize if sentences are incomprehensible to learners or use excessive advanced vocabulary\n\n9. NO DUPLICATES:\n   - Each sentence should be unique\n   - Avoid near-duplicates (same sentence with minor word changes)\n   - Penalize if essentially the same sentence appears multiple times\n\n10. LANGUAGE CORRECTNESS:\n    - Sentences should be in the TARGET language (courseTitle)\n    - Translations should be in the NATIVE language (language code)\n    - Penalize if languages are swapped or mixed incorrectly\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific sentence choices - accept ANY valid sentences that use the vocabulary\n- Do NOT penalize for not including specific contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of sentences\n- Do NOT expect sentences to follow any particular template or pattern\n- Different valid sentence constructions exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- FOCUS ON: vocabulary usage, translation accuracy, romanization correctness, grammatical correctness, naturalness\n\n    ",

The sentences show good variety in context (restaurants, home dining, cultural facts about French cuisine). Grammar is correct throughout. Natural phrasing like 'Je voudrais du pain' and 'Qu'est-ce que vous avez comme dessert' demonstrate authentic French. No duplicates. The only minor issue is sentence 6 uses 'Ce pain' (demonstrative) rather than 'le pain' but it's still using the vocabulary appropriately.",
