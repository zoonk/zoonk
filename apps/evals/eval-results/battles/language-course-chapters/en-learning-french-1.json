It follows almost all prompt rules: no skill-based chapters, no culture/literature/exam prep chapters. Grammar is broken into fine-grained chapters (separate chapters for direct vs indirect object pronouns, passé composé with avoir vs être, multiple subjunctive chapters, relative clause progression, etc.). Vocabulary themes are well-covered (food, shopping, health, weather, travel, home, education, technology, environment). Communication scenarios are present (greetings, requests, directions, phone calls, etc.). The interleaving of grammar and vocabulary is well done. It includes good advanced/C2 content (literary past tenses, reduced clauses, pragmatic nuance, wordplay & ambiguity, conversation management, regional variation). Descriptions are concise and on-point, avoiding fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore'. One minor concern: 'Work & Occupations' could be seen as borderline career/professional, but as vocabulary it's standard and the prompt only forbids 'career/professional chapters' like business language and workplace communication, whereas basic job/occupation vocabulary is a standard vocabulary theme mentioned in the prompt itself. The chapter 'High-Precision Grammar Review' has 'review' in the name which could be seen as assessment-adjacent, but it's really about stabilizing accuracy. Overall, this is an exceptionally thorough and well-organized curriculum.",

Vocabulary themes are comprehensive (food, home, health, weather, travel, shopping, technology, environment, emotions). Communication scenarios are present. The progression is logical and well-ordered. Descriptions are generally concise. However, there are some concerns: 'News & Media Language' could be seen as a media chapter (explicitly forbidden), though it's more about vocabulary than media analysis. 'Formal Writing & Correspondence' is somewhat skill-based (writing), which is built into every lesson. 'Work & Occupations' is borderline but acceptable as vocabulary. 'Specialized & Technical Vocabulary' is vague. 'Regional Variations of French' borders on culture. Some descriptions use 'building' which is mildly filler-ish.

Vocabulary themes are covered though somewhat fewer dedicated vocabulary chapters compared to top models. The interleaving is good. Descriptions are concise and well-written. However, several chapters are problematic: 'Near-Native Fluency' as a final chapter is vague and feels like a capstone. 'Style & Naturalness' and 'Ambiguity & Reformulation' are somewhat abstract and skill-oriented. 'Accuracy: High-Frequency Errors' reads like an assessment/review chapter. 'Paraphrase & Synthesis' is somewhat skill-based. Some C2-level chapters are quite abstract. Missing some vocabulary domains that other models cover (work/occupations is absent, money/banking absent). No dedicated chapter for hobbies/sports until later.

'Mastery Grammar & Rare Constructions' is vague. 'Colloquial Speech & Regional Variants' partially touches culture. The vocabulary themes are somewhat fewer and placed late in the curriculum (Food & Dining at chapter 36, Shopping at 37, Travel at 38), which is unusual - these are typically A1-B1 topics but appear after advanced grammar. This ordering issue is significant: basic vocabulary topics shouldn't come after subjunctive mood and conditional sentences. Some descriptions use filler words. The interleaving is poor in the middle-to-late sections where vocabulary chapters are clustered together after heavy grammar. Overall decent content but the ordering is problematic and some chapters are borderline forbidden.",

The curriculum feels incomplete for claiming to cover A1-C2 mastery. 'Society & Politics' is borderline culture/career. The C2 content is thin (Abstract Concepts, Stylistic Inversions, Idioms & Colloquialisms).
