However, content chapters that USE these skills as a vehicle for teaching language are valid: \"Complex Texts & Critical Analysis\" (advanced vocabulary/comprehension), \"Formal Correspondence\" (grammar/expressions for letters), \"Academic Discourse\" (register/vocabulary). The test: is the chapter about the skill itself, or about language content delivered through that medium?\n  - NO culture chapters that teach about a country/region's history, traditions, or customs as the primary content (e.g., \"History of France\", \"Japanese Festivals\", \"Brazilian Carnival\"). However, vocabulary chapters that teach culture-related words and expressions ARE valid: \"Arts & Entertainment Vocabulary\" (how to discuss art, music, film in the target language), \"Food & Dining\" (restaurant vocabulary, ordering expressions), \"News & Media Language\" (media-related vocabulary/register).

The granularity is excellent — it separates passé composé with avoir vs être, breaks down relative pronouns into qui/que, où/dont, and lequel, separates direct vs indirect object pronouns, and covers advanced topics like passé simple recognition, formal subjunctive recognition, false friends, collocations, word formation, irony & understatement, dislocation & topicalization, and cohesion & reference. Grammar and vocabulary chapters are well-interleaved. Descriptions are concise and avoid fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore'. No forbidden chapter types appear — no skill-based, culture, career, exam prep, or literature chapters. The 'Everyday Instructions' chapter is borderline but acceptable as it covers classroom interaction language. 'Formal Emails & Forms' and 'Administrative Tasks' are vocabulary/communication scenario chapters, not career chapters. 'Messaging & Short Replies' is a communication scenario. The coverage is truly exhaustive with attention to French-specific features like agreement with en, on/impersonal constructions, and advanced article nuance. Minor issues: some chapters could be seen as slightly overlapping (e.g., 'Passé Composé: Core Forms' and 'Passé Composé with Avoir' seem redundant), and some titles could be more descriptive. Overall, this is the most thorough and well-structured curriculum.",

Vocabulary themes are well-covered (food, health, sports, technology, environment, society). Communication scenarios are included (ordering at restaurants, phone calls, invitations, small talk, giving advice). Descriptions are generally concise and avoid fluff. The interleaving of grammar and vocabulary is good. It includes some potentially borderline chapters: 'Regional & Francophone Variations' could be seen as culture-adjacent but is about linguistic variation which is valid. 'Spelling & Punctuation' could be seen as skill-based but is really about language mechanics. 'Formal Writing Conventions' teaches language content through writing as a medium. 'Law & Administration' and 'Science & Research' are vocabulary chapters, not career chapters. 'Society & Current Events' is vocabulary-focused. The curriculum is well-ordered and comprehensive. Minor deductions: 'Formal Writing Conventions' is borderline as a skill-based chapter (writing skills), and some descriptions use slightly fluffy language.",

However, some later chapters become quite abstract and vague: 'Full Command Integration', 'High-Stakes Interaction', 'Extended Discourse Style', 'Precision & Disambiguation' — these feel like filler and lack specific content domains. The vocabulary coverage is somewhat thin compared to other models — missing explicit chapters for education, sports/hobbies, emotions, work/occupations, and animals/nature as standalone topics (though some are covered implicitly). 'High-Accuracy Grammar Control' feels like a skill-based chapter rather than a content chapter. The final few chapters feel like padding rather than substantive content domains.

However, the curriculum is less granular than models C and E — it combines topics that could benefit from separation (e.g., 'Future Tense' combines near future and futur simple, 'Object Pronouns' combines direct and indirect). Some chapters are borderline: 'Conversational Fluency' at the end is somewhat skill-based rather than content-domain focused.

'Colloquialisms and Argot' is a good inclusion. The coverage of vocabulary themes is adequate but not as extensive (missing education, administrative tasks, phone calls, formal correspondence).

Some important areas are underdeveloped: passé composé is covered in one chapter rather than splitting avoir/être, relative pronouns get one chapter, and the subjunctive gets only two chapters. The B1-C2 progression feels rushed. Missing important topics: demonstrative pronouns, possessive pronouns, indefinite pronouns, passé simple, future anterior, plus-que-parfait, gerund/present participle, adverbs as a standalone topic, and prepositions with verbs. The 'Work & Occupations' chapter is included but explicitly says 'without specialized business jargon' which helps it avoid the career prohibition.

'Refined Argumentation' mentions 'analytical essays and syntheses' which could be seen as skill-based (writing). 'Science & Environment' is a good vocabulary chapter. The curriculum is less granular than the best models — many important topics are single chapters that could benefit from expansion. Missing or thin areas: no explicit chapters on adverbs, prepositions with verbs, stressed pronouns, possessive pronouns, indefinite pronouns/adjectives (some of these might be embedded but deserve explicit chapters for completeness). 'Rhetorical Devices' with 'persuasive writing' leans toward skill-based. The title 'Basic Greetings & Social Etiquette' uses 'etiquette' which has cultural connotations but is acceptable as it covers social expressions. The passé simple is included, which is good.
