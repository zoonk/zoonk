It follows prompt rules very well: no skill-based chapters, no culture chapters, no career/professional chapters, no exam prep, no literature/media chapters. The granularity is excellent — it separates grammar topics well (e.g., preterite regular vs irregular, direct vs indirect object pronouns, multiple subjunctive chapters). Spanish-specific grammar is thoroughly covered: ser vs estar (split across two chapters), preterite vs imperfect, subjunctive across 8+ chapters, por vs para, personal a, uses of se, conditional sentences, como si constructions, reported speech, passive constructions, periphrastic verbs, etc. Vocabulary themes are well covered (food, shopping, travel, health, weather, technology, housing). Communication scenarios are included (complaints, invitations, opinions, agreement/disagreement). The interleaving of grammar and vocabulary is natural. Descriptions are concise and avoid fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore'. Titles are clean and professional. The progression from beginner to advanced is logical and well-ordered. Minor notes: 'Accent Marks and Spelling Traps' could be seen as borderline skill-based, but it's really about orthographic rules which are content. Overall this is the strongest curriculum.",

Spanish-specific grammar is thoroughly addressed: ser & estar, preterite, imperfect, subjunctive (multiple chapters including present, past, perfect, stance), conditional sentences, passive constructions, reported speech, por vs para, uses of se (split into two chapters), periphrastic verbs. Vocabulary themes are covered (food, family, weather, clothing, health, travel, shopping, hobbies). The interleaving is good. Descriptions are concise and mostly avoid fluff. Titles are clean and specific. Advanced topics like word formation, abstract expression, precision & hedging, pragmatics & persuasion, and native-like coherence round out the C2 level. Some chapters like 'Everyday Work Talk' might seem borderline career but it's framed as general vocabulary which is acceptable. The curriculum is slightly less granular than Model B in some areas (e.g., object pronouns combined rather than separated, commands in one chapter rather than two), but it compensates with excellent advanced-level chapters. Very strong overall.",

Spanish-specific topics are covered. Vocabulary themes include food, shopping, travel, health, emergencies, technology, education. However, there are some issues: 'Conversational Fluency & Repair Strategies' is borderline skill-based (fluency strategies, fillers, turn-taking). 'Complex Discourse Production & Register Integration' also leans skill-based. 'Specialized Registers & Terminology' mentioning 'medical, legal, technical' domain-specific vocabulary could be seen as professional/career territory. 'Slang, Taboo Language & Register Constraints' is borderline. Some descriptions use slightly more verbose phrasing. The interleaving of grammar and vocabulary is decent but the later chapters cluster heavily toward grammar/advanced structures. Still a solid curriculum overall.",

'Complex Texts & Critical Analysis' is explicitly a reading/skill-based chapter and also mentions 'opinion pieces, editorials' which borders on media/literature. 'Fluency & Spontaneous Expression' is skill-based. 'Negotiation & Diplomacy' borders on career/professional. Some vocabulary chapters like 'Law, Government & Civic Life', 'Economics & Global Issues', and 'Science & Technology' are very broad domain chapters that could be seen as acceptable vocabulary expansion, though they push boundaries.

While it covers core grammar (present, preterite, imperfect, future, conditional, subjunctive, reported speech, passive voice) and basic vocabulary themes (food, family, health, travel, shopping, weather), the coverage is insufficient for a complete A1-C2 curriculum. Many important topics are missing or insufficiently covered: no dedicated chapters for reflexive verb depth, no possessives/demonstratives chapter, no questions/interrogatives chapter, limited subjunctive coverage (only 4-5 chapters vs 8+ in better models), no dedicated chapter for uses of se, limited vocabulary themes at advanced levels, no word formation/diminutives, no discourse markers, no relative clauses with prepositions, minimal communication scenario chapters. 'Abstract Concepts & Philosophy' is a borderline inclusion. The descriptions are clean and concise, titles follow guidelines.
