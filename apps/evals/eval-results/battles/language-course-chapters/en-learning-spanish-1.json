However, content chapters that USE these skills as a vehicle for teaching language are valid: \"Complex Texts & Critical Analysis\" (advanced vocabulary/comprehension), \"Formal Correspondence\" (grammar/expressions for letters), \"Academic Discourse\" (register/vocabulary). The test: is the chapter about the skill itself, or about language content delivered through that medium?\n  - NO culture chapters that teach about a country/region's history, traditions, or customs as the primary content (e.g., \"History of France\", \"Japanese Festivals\", \"Brazilian Carnival\"). However, vocabulary chapters that teach culture-related words and expressions ARE valid: \"Arts & Entertainment Vocabulary\" (how to discuss art, music, film in the target language), \"Food & Dining\" (restaurant vocabulary, ordering expressions), \"News & Media Language\" (media-related vocabulary/register). The test: is the chapter teaching ABOUT the culture, or teaching language THROUGH cultural topics?\n  - NO career or professional chapters (business language, workplace communication)\n  - NO proficiency exam preparation chapters (DELE, JLPT, DELF, HSK, etc.)\n  - NO literature or media chapters (books, films, songs, poetry)\n  - Should cover grammar structures (verb tenses, nouns, articles, etc.) and vocabulary themes (food, travel, health, etc.)\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Titles should be concise, no filler words\n  - Descriptions should be concise, no fluff (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the chapter content quality\n  - Don't add capstone/final projects, assessments, or exercises\n\n    ",

Strengths: (1) Excellent interleaving of grammar and vocabulary/communication chapters throughout, creating a natural learning flow. (2) Spanish-specific grammar is thoroughly covered: ser vs estar, preterite vs imperfect, subjunctive in multiple chapters (present, dependent clauses, adverbial clauses, mood contrasts, past, perfect forms), por vs para, se constructions, conditional sentences, etc. (3) Advanced/C2 content is particularly strong with chapters on aspect/temporal nuance, derivation/expressive morphology, copulas and meaning, periphrasis, certainty/evidentiality, concession/contrast, advanced hypotheticals, figurative meaning/pragmatics, formal style, regional variation, high-precision grammar, lexical precision, automaticity, and low-frequency structures. (4) No forbidden chapter types appear — no skill-based, culture, career, exam prep, or literature chapters. (5) Titles are concise and professional. (6) Descriptions are direct, no fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore.' (7) The progression from fundamentals to mastery is logical and well-paced. Minor issues: Some titles could be slightly more specific (e.g., 'Core Sentence Building' is a bit vague), but descriptions clarify well. The curriculum doesn't have a dedicated 'Education' vocabulary chapter, but this is minor. Overall, this is the most comprehensive and well-designed curriculum.",

Strengths: (1) Very fine-grained breakdown — separating spelling-change preterites, irregular yo forms, stem-changing verbs into individual chapters shows excellent pedagogical thinking. (2) Excellent interleaving of grammar and vocabulary throughout. (3) Subjunctive coverage is outstanding with 10+ chapters covering every aspect (wishes/influence, emotions/judgments, doubt/denial, adjective clauses, time clauses, purpose/conditions, concession, imperfect, sequence of tenses, present perfect, pluperfect, infinitive vs subjunctive). (4) Spanish-specific content is thorough: ser vs estar, por vs para, personal 'a', poder vs saber, gustar-type verbs, voseo. (5) Advanced content is strong: modality/evidentiality, nominalization, collocations, figurative language, stance/hedging, argumentation, regional variation. (6) No forbidden chapter types. (7) Descriptions are mostly concise and direct. Minor issues: (1) 'Names, Email & Phone Numbers' feels like a thin chapter. (2) Orthography chapters ('Accent Marks' and 'Punctuation & Formatting') are borderline — they could be seen as skill-based, though they teach language content. (3) 'Measurements & Technical Quantities' feels somewhat niche. (4) Some descriptions use slightly casual tone ('what's happening now'). (5) The sheer number of chapters (115) might indicate over-granularity in places, but this is a minor concern for a comprehensive curriculum. The orthography chapters are a slight concern but they are about language rules, not skills per se.",

(2) 'Specialized Vocabulary: Legal & Medical' is explicitly professional/career-focused vocabulary, which is borderline forbidden ('NO career/professional chapters'). (3) 'Housing & Neighborhood' is fine but somewhat duplicative with earlier 'Home & Daily Life.' (4) Some descriptions use 'discussing' which is slightly filler-ish but acceptable. (5) The C2-level content could be stronger — there's less coverage of truly advanced structures like nominalization, cleft sentences, evidentiality compared to Models A and E.

Concerns: (1) 'Arts & Entertainment' — the prompt says 'NO literature or media chapters — no film, TV, novels, poetry, news media analysis.' The description mentions 'Fine arts, theater, cinema genres, and musical vocabulary.' This is borderline — it's teaching vocabulary for discussing these topics, not the media itself, but it's risky. (2) 'Science & Innovation' and 'Social Issues & Community' and 'Abstract Concepts & Ideologies' are vocabulary chapters but feel somewhat broad. (3) The WEIRDO acronym in 'Subjunctive with WEIRDO' is a teaching methodology reference that feels out of place in a chapter title.

(2) 'Philosophy & Logic' seems like a culture/content chapter rather than a language-learning chapter — it's about teaching philosophical concepts rather than language through philosophy.
