  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n      - Should break down each HTML element type into separate lessons\n      - Should cover attributes, forms, multimedia, and accessibility as distinct concepts\n      - Should not group multiple element types together (e.g., not \"Lists and Tables\" but separate lessons)\n      \n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - If you find yourself using \"AND\", \"OR\", or \"VS\" in a title, you should split it into separate lessons\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to cover all the concepts needed to learn the chapter. Complex topics will usually requiere more than 100 lessons\n  \n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",
