  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in Brazilian Portuguese\n      - Should break down each legal tech concept individually (templates, document review, version control)\n      - Should cover automation risks and governance as distinct lessons\n      - Should separate document management from quality standardization\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching litigation strategy or dispute portfolio management (neighboring chapter \"Estratégia contenciosa e gestão de disputas\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching legal operations management, SLAs, or KPIs (neighboring chapter \"Legal operations e gestão jurídica\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching contract lifecycle management or CLM (neighboring chapter \"Operações contratuais\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching negotiation techniques, BATNA, or ZOPA (neighboring chapter \"Negociação estratégica\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

Titles are concise, specific, and avoid fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore'. Descriptions are 1-2 sentences, straight to the point. It properly avoids neighboring chapter topics (no CLM, no litigation strategy, no legal ops KPIs/SLAs, no negotiation). It fully covers all chapter description topics: templates, revisão assistida, gestão documental, padronização, riscos de automação, controle de versões, and governança de conhecimento. The granularity is appropriate — topics like templates are broken into placeholders, conditional blocks, repetition blocks, tables, mandatory clauses, default values, etc. Some lessons could arguably be even more focused (e.g., 'Automação de documentos: escopo' combines scope definition with where automation adds value), but overall this is the strongest output. Minor issues: a few titles could be slightly more descriptive, and some lessons like 'OCR em PDFs' and 'Links com expiração' are somewhat tangential but still within scope.",
