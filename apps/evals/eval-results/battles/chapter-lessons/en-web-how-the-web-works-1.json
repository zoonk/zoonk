It covers all chapter topics extensively: clients/servers, IP (IPv4/IPv6, public/private, routing, packets, NAT), DNS (hierarchy, root servers, TLD, authoritative, resolver, resolution, caching, TTL, A/AAAA/CNAME/NS/TXT records, propagation, anycast), HTTP/HTTPS (statelessness, request/response - though it treads slightly into neighboring chapter territory here), TLS (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, certificates, chain, CA, expiration, revocation, transparency, ClientHello, ServerHello, key agreement, SNI, ALPN), proxies (forward, reverse, load balancer, transparent, CONNECT tunnel, TLS termination, re-encryption), caching (cache key, freshness, hit/miss, revalidation, stale, browser cache, shared cache, cache busting), cookies (cookie jar, domain scope, path scope, Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite, session, persistent, third-party, sending rules), and CDNs (PoP, edge cache, origin fetch, request routing, anycast, invalidation, reverse proxy, dynamic acceleration). It maintains single-concept focus throughout, avoids 'AND'/'OR'/'VS' in titles, and has concise descriptions. Some lessons like HTTP request/response structure and TCP/UDP may slightly overlap with neighboring chapters, but they're contextual enough. The granularity is excellent - breaking TLS into ClientHello/ServerHello/key agreement, and separating cache hit from cache miss. Minor issues: a few lessons (TCP, UDP, TCP handshake) go beyond the chapter scope into transport layer details not mentioned in the chapter description. Some titles could be slightly more descriptive. Overall the best balance of comprehensiveness, granularity, and adherence to rules.",

DNS coverage is thorough (resolver, recursive resolver, authoritative nameserver, zone, A/AAAA/CNAME/NS/SOA records, TTL, caching, resolution order, reverse DNS, NXDOMAIN, DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS, spoofing, DNSSEC). TLS coverage is excellent (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, handshake, TLS 1.3, session resumption, certificates, CA, trust store, certificate chain, root/intermediate certificates, hostname verification, validity period, revocation, CRL, OCSP, OCSP stapling, domain validation). CDN coverage is strong (origin server, edge PoP, edge server, origin fetch, cache warming, latency reduction, traffic absorption, DDoS mitigation, edge computing, request flow, stale content, invalidation). However, there are issues: several lessons go beyond chapter scope (LAN, WAN, ISP, switch, MAC address, ARP, subnet, subnet mask are networking fundamentals not in the chapter description). Some lessons overlap with neighboring chapters (HTTP request, HTTP response, HTTP payload, HTTP request target, 'HTTP as a message protocol' overlap with 'HTTP fundamentals'; tokenization and CORS seem out of scope). The title 'IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format' in the original was a concern but Model D correctly splits them. 'Memory cache' and 'Disk cache' feel like implementation details beyond scope.

The lesson on 'What is a socket?' adds useful networking context. 'Stateless versus stateful behavior' is relevant to HTTP concepts. However, there are issues: the title 'Stateless versus stateful behavior' uses 'versus' which the rules say should be split. The lesson count of 42 is below the expected 100+ for this chapter. CDN coverage is minimal (only 3 lessons: what is CDN, edge server, origin server - missing request routing, invalidation, benefits). Proxy coverage is thin (only forward proxy, reverse proxy, load balancing - 3 lessons). Missing some important concepts like DNS TTL, public/private IP distinction, ports, HTTP statelessness explicitly, cookie use cases. Descriptions are concise and well-written.

'Cookie Security Attributes' groups Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite together - this should be split into separate lessons. 'DNS Record Types' groups A, AAAA, CNAME, MX together - too broad. 'Common Proxy Use Cases' and 'Common Cookie Use Cases' are somewhat summary-like. The lesson count of 43 is below the expected 100+.
