  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n      - Should separate stylized facts from theoretical models\n      - Should cover each type of comovement individually\n      - Should distinguish business cycle measurement from theory\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching national income accounting or GDP measurement (neighboring chapter \"Macroeconomic accounting\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine. IMPORTANT: Business cycle measurement methodology (e.g., cycle dating, leading/lagging indicators, diffusion indices) IS within scope — these are tools for identifying and characterizing business cycles, not general national accounting concepts. Only penalize if a lesson teaches GDP construction, price index methodology, or sectoral balances as its own subject\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching consumption-savings models or life-cycle theory (neighboring chapter \"Consumption and savings\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine. IMPORTANT: Documenting the empirical cyclical behavior of consumption (e.g., \"Consumption Comovement\") IS within scope as a business cycle fact; only penalize if the lesson teaches consumption theory itself (permanent income hypothesis, life-cycle model, etc.)\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching investment theory or q-models (neighboring chapter \"Investment and capital\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine. IMPORTANT: Documenting the empirical cyclical behavior of investment (e.g., \"Investment Comovement\") IS within scope as a business cycle fact; only penalize if the lesson teaches investment theory itself (q-models, adjustment costs, etc.)\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching labor market search models or wage setting (neighboring chapter \"Unemployment and labor in macro\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine. IMPORTANT: Documenting the empirical cyclical behavior of unemployment/employment IS within scope as a business cycle fact; only penalize if the lesson teaches labor market theory itself (search and matching, wage bargaining, etc.)\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

It covers all major areas: business cycle definition and phases, measurement methodology (detrending, HP filter, band-pass filters via the detrending lesson), stylized facts, comovements across many variables (consumption, investment, hours, wages, profits, credit, asset prices, trade), sectoral comovements (durables, construction, services, cross-sector, supply chain propagation), inflation patterns (cyclicality, slack, stagflation, cost-push, demand-pull, persistence, expectations), unemployment patterns (cyclicality, lag, Okun's law, discouraged workers, labor force participation, scarring), and productivity (labor productivity, TFP, labor hoarding, capacity utilization, composition effects, reallocation, cleansing effect). It properly separates stylized facts from theoretical models and covers each comovement individually. The neighboring chapter boundaries are mostly respected—it documents empirical cyclical behavior of consumption, investment, and unemployment without teaching their underlying theories. Some potential issues: lessons on 'Unemployment: concept', 'Unemployment rate', 'Employment', 'Price level' border on being too basic/definitional and could be seen as belonging to macroeconomic accounting. The lessons on 'Discouraged workers', 'Involuntary part-time work', and 'Scarring effects' push slightly into labor market territory but are presented through a cyclical lens. A few lessons could arguably be combined (e.g., 'Labor hoarding' and 'Labor hoarding and productivity' seem redundant). Some titles use colons with 'concept' which is slightly stylistically inconsistent. Overall, this is the most comprehensive and well-structured output.",

It also covers international synchronization, Great Moderation, regime changes, specific historical episodes (GFC, pandemic), diffusion index, input-output propagation, real-time data revisions, and filter sensitivity. The granularity is excellent—each lesson is well-scoped to a single concept. Neighboring chapter boundaries are well respected; empirical cyclical behavior is documented without teaching underlying theories. Some minor issues: 'Depression', 'Double-dip recession', 'Jobless recovery', 'Slowdown' are somewhat tangential additions. 'Layoff inflows' and 'Job-finding outflows' push slightly into labor market search/matching territory.
