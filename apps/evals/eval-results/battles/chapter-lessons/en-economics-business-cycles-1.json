  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n\n      \n  # How to evaluate\n\n  You are evaluating a CURRICULUM, not a glossary. Think like a curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use domain expertise and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single, specific idea — something a domain expert would consider one teachable unit\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT teachable items that a student would need separate lessons for\n  - Use domain expertise: terms that sound broad to a generalist may be a single well-defined concept in the field\n  - Conjunctions (AND/OR/VS and equivalents in any language) signal potential broadness, but only penalize when they join genuinely separate topics — not when the comparison itself IS the concept, or when \"and\" connects an entity to its work\n  - Concept titles should be concrete and self-explanatory, not interpretive thesis statements or vague abstractions\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",

It covers all topics from the chapter description (output, inflation, unemployment, productivity, comovements across sectors) with excellent granularity. Key strengths: (1) Exhaustive coverage including data measurement issues, detrending methods, statistical moments, output fluctuations, GDP components, labor market facts, productivity, inflation, financial variables, sectoral comovement, international comovement, and asymmetries. (2) Concept granularity is consistently good — most concepts are single teachable ideas. (3) Lesson sizes vary naturally (6-8 concepts). (4) Lesson descriptions go straight to content without filler words. (5) Good awareness of neighboring chapters — consumption/investment/unemployment concepts are framed as cyclical facts rather than theory. (6) Includes important concepts others miss like diffusion index, Okun's law, labor hoarding, factor utilization, Great Moderation-adjacent ideas (recession/expansion duration), data issues. Minor issues: 'Classical business cycle' could be more specific; the data comparability lesson (seasonal adjustment, chain-weighting) is somewhat tangential but defensible. A few concept titles like 'Volatility' alone are slightly generic but contextually clear within their lessons. Overall, this is the most complete and well-organized output.",

(3) Includes topics others miss like firm entry/exit cyclicality, default rates, bankruptcy rates, capacity utilization. (4) Good neighboring chapter awareness. (5) Lesson descriptions are content-focused. Weaknesses: (1) Some concepts may be too granular or niche for a chapter on business cycle facts (e.g., 'Coefficient of variation in macro series', 'Stochastic trend volatility', 'Firm entry cyclicality', 'Bankruptcy rate cyclicality'). (2) The 'Utilization and firm dynamics' lesson ventures somewhat beyond the chapter's described scope. (3) Some redundancy between lessons (e.g., procyclical/countercyclical/acyclical appears in comovement lesson, and similar classifications reappear). (4) 'Countercyclical productivity' and 'Procyclical productivity' as separate concepts is slightly odd — the stylized fact is generally that productivity is procyclical.

This violates the explicit 8-concept maximum rule. The comovement lesson at 12 concepts should clearly have been split. (2) Concept naming issues: 'Business Cycle Phases: Expansion' etc. uses a colon-separated format that's unusual. 'Detrending Methods Comparison' uses comparison framing.
