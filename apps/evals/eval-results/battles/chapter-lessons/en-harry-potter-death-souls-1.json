Titles are concise and avoid 'AND/OR/VS' (with rare exceptions like 'Fear of death: Motivator' which is fine). The progression is logical: it starts with death/soul foundations, moves through Horcrux mechanics in great detail (creation process broken into tear→sever→encase, each specific Horcrux vessel with individual lessons, influence mechanics, destruction methods), then covers Deathly Hallows individually, and finishes with moral/philosophical implications. The descriptions are concise, no-fluff, and avoid forbidden words like 'learn/understand/explore'. It respects neighboring chapter boundaries — no dedicated lessons on Legilimency, time-turners, wards, or curse-breaking. The individual Horcrux lessons (diary purpose, diary writing channel, diary persona construct, diary life siphon; ring trap design, ring curse backlash; locket wearable vector, locket mood dampening; etc.) show exceptional granularity. The moral/philosophical implications are broken into separate focused lessons (empathy erosion, cruelty normalization, people as tools, fixation narrows morality, mortality fosters compassion, legacy over persistence). Coverage is comprehensive. Minor issues: some lessons could arguably be split further, but overall this is the most thorough and well-structured output.",

The progression is logical, moving from foundational concepts (deathly magic scope, body death, soul definition) through Horcrux mechanics, influence dynamics, destruction, then Deathly Hallows, and finally moral/philosophical implications. Titles are concise and focused. Descriptions are brief and to-the-point without fluff words. The lesson on Horcrux influence is well broken down (passivity, influence, vulnerability, escalation). The moral/philosophical section is particularly strong with nuanced concepts (moral narrowing, permanence bias, identity reframing, shadow self continuation, dehumanization feedback loop). It respects neighboring chapter boundaries. However, it doesn't break down individual Horcrux objects (diary, ring, locket, cup, diadem, Nagini, Harry) into separate lessons, which is a notable gap in coverage. The 'Remorse vs Regret' title uses 'VS' which violates the rules. Some lessons in the moral section could be seen as somewhat abstract/overlapping.",

It includes relevant topics like the Philosopher's Stone, ghosts, the Veil, Priori Incantatem, and sacrificial protection. Descriptions are generally concise. However, there are several issues: the title 'Horcruxes Versus Hallows: Two Paths to Immortality' uses 'Versus' which violates the rules. Some descriptions use slightly fluffy phrasing. The lesson 'Lily's Sacrifice: Love as Lethal Magic' and 'Love as the Ultimate Counter to Deathly Magic' border on overlapping. The overall granularity is moderate — not as finely broken down as Models F or A, but still solid. It respects neighboring chapter boundaries.

Several lessons are too broad: 'Voldemort's Seven Horcruxes: The Strategy' tries to cover all seven in one lesson, 'The Elder Wand: Power and Allegiance' combines two concepts (violating the AND rule implicitly), 'Comparing Wizarding Approaches to Extended Life' is very broad. Some titles contain colons with subtitles that combine concepts. Descriptions occasionally use slightly fluffy language. However, the content is accurate, the progression is logical, and it covers the major topics. It includes good contextual elements like ghosts, King's Cross, the Philosopher's Stone comparison.

Some lessons venture beyond the chapter's scope into speculative territory not well-grounded in the Harry Potter canon: 'Inequality from selective immortality,' 'Political consolidation through extended life,' 'Legal prohibitions related to immortality,' 'Cultural responses to immortality seekers,' 'Generational consequences of longevity,' 'Responsibility toward the resurrected' — these feel like generic philosophy/ethics lessons rather than Harry Potter-specific content. The chapter description says 'how immortality attempts reshape morality,' but these lessons are too abstract and sociological. It also doesn't cover individual Horcrux objects at all. The Deathly Hallows section is adequate but not deeply granular. On the positive side, each lesson is single-concept focused, descriptions avoid fluff, and it doesn't violate neighboring chapter boundaries.

The lessons that exist are well-focused and concise. 'Unicorn Blood' and 'The Cursed Half-Life' are relevant additions.

The Elixir of Life and Unicorn Blood sections, while relevant, take up space that could have been used for deeper Horcrux/Hallows coverage. Some descriptions are vague: 'The first Hallow' assumes reader knowledge of ordering. 'Fragmented Souls in Limbo' is somewhat vague in description. The lesson list fails to be 'extensive' as required.
