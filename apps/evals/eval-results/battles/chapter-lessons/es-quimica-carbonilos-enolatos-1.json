  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in Latin American Spanish\n      - Should separate nucleophilic addition to carbonyls from enolate chemistry\n      - Should break down each named reaction (Aldol, Claisen, Michael) as individual lessons\n      - Should cover selectivity control concepts as distinct lessons\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching SN1/SN2 or elimination reactions (neighboring chapter \"Sustitución y eliminación\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching additions to alkenes or alkynes (neighboring chapter \"Adiciones a alquenos y alquinos\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching aromatic chemistry or electrophilic aromatic substitution (neighboring chapter \"Química aromática\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching general carboxylic acid derivative reactivity or acyl substitution chemistry (neighboring chapter \"Ácidos carboxílicos y derivados\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine. IMPORTANT: The Claisen condensation and Dieckmann cyclization ARE explicitly within this chapter's scope (listed in the chapter description as enolate reactions). Do NOT penalize lessons on Claisen/Dieckmann mechanism, enolate-of-ester formation, or related selectivity — these are enolate chemistry, not acyl substitution\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

It systematically breaks down: (1) Carbonyl structure and reactivity (polarization, geometry, electronic effects, steric effects, aldehyde vs ketone reactivity), (2) Nucleophilic addition mechanism (steps, intermediary, protonation, rate-determining step, reversibility), (3) Protection/deprotection of carbonyls, (4) Keto-enol tautomerism and enolization (acid/base catalyzed), (5) Enolate chemistry in great detail (resonance, O vs C coordination, pKa, formation with different bases, kinetic vs thermodynamic, regioselectivity, chelation direction, silyl enol ethers, enamines), (6) O- vs C-alkylation, (7) 1,2 vs 1,4 addition with HSAB rationale, (8) Cuprates, (9) Aldol reaction broken into many focused lessons (product, C-C step, protonation, reversibility, self-aldol, crossed aldol strategies, dehydration, E1cb mechanism, E/Z selectivity), (10) Claisen condensation broken into many steps (product, base choice, enolate formation, tetrahedral intermediate, alkoxide elimination, driving force, workup, crossed Claisen), (11) Dieckmann with ring size considerations, (12) Michael reaction (product, acceptor, donor, C-C step, protonation, reactivity), (13) Robinson annulation broken into connectivity, Michael step, aldol cyclization, dehydration, (14) Selectivity control (chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity including syn/anti, Zimmerman-Traxler, facial selectivity, chelation control, kinetic vs thermodynamic). The lessons are well-ordered with logical progression. Titles are mostly concise and specific. Some lessons have identical descriptions (lessons 5 and 6 about aldehyde vs ketone reactivity share the same description, which is a flaw). A few titles could be seen as slightly overlapping (e.g., 'Condiciones para control cinético' and 'Condiciones para control termodinámico' alongside 'Control cinético de selectividad' and 'Control termodinámico de selectividad'). It doesn't cover some topics like Wittig, Grignard additions, hydride reductions, hydrates, hemiacetals/acetals, imines, cyanohydrins — these are nucleophilic additions to carbonyls explicitly mentioned in the chapter scope. This is a significant gap. However, it does cover protection as acetal. Actually, looking more carefully, it doesn't cover the specific nucleophilic addition reactions (Grignard, hydrides, water, alcohols, HCN, amines) which are core to 'Adición nucleofílica a carbonilos'. This is a notable omission. It focuses heavily on enolate chemistry and selectivity but misses a large chunk of nucleophilic addition content. Also it doesn't cover halogenation alpha, haloform reaction, or alkylation of enolates explicitly. These are important omissions. Adjusting score down for these gaps.",

The coverage is extremely thorough. However, there are significant issues: many lessons are TOO narrow and feel like padding (e.g., separate lessons for 'NaBH4: compatibilidad con solventes próticos', 'NaBH4: quimioselectividad típica', 'NaBH4: reducción de cetonas lenta' — these should be one lesson). The Grignard section has 5+ lessons that are overly fragmented. Some lessons border on trivial ('Trabajo ácido: protonación del alcoholato'). The title format 'X: Y' is used extensively and creates some odd entries. Some lessons slightly venture into territory that could overlap with neighboring chapters (e.g., extensive NaBH4/LiAlH4 details could overlap with general reactivity). Missing Wittig reaction, which is a notable gap for carbonyl chemistry. Missing Robinson annulation, which is explicitly relevant. Missing malonic/acetoacetic ester synthesis. Despite being extensive, some lessons feel artificially split while missing important topics. The sheer volume includes some redundancy (selectivity lessons at the end repeat concepts covered earlier).",

Puntos en contra: varias lecciones siguen siendo algo “macro” (p.ej., “Teoría HSAB…”, “Desconexiones retrosintéticas…”) y algunas mezclan más de un concepto; también usa “versus” en algunos títulos aunque el concepto comparativo lo justifica.

También roza el tema de SN2 en el título/descripción de alquilación de enolatos; es contextual, pero se vuelve un mini-tema. Granularidad y cumplimiento de reglas de títulos peor que B/C/F.",
