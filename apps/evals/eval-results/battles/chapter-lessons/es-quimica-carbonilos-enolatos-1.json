Think like a curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use domain expertise and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single, specific idea — something a domain expert would consider one teachable unit\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT teachable items that a student would need separate lessons for\n  - Use domain expertise: terms that sound broad to a generalist may be a single well-defined concept in the field\n  - Conjunctions (AND/OR/VS and equivalents in any language) signal potential broadness, but only penalize when they join genuinely separate topics — not when the comparison itself IS the concept, or when \"and\" connects an entity to its work\n  - Concept titles should be concrete and self-explanatory, not interpretive thesis statements or vague abstractions\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",

It has 26 lessons with approximately 200 concepts, covering every topic in the chapter description thoroughly: carbonyl structure, addition mechanisms, enol/enolate chemistry, aldol, Claisen, Michael, selectivity control, stereochemistry, silyl enol ethers, organocatalysis, and 1,3-dicarbonyl chemistry. Concept granularity is excellent — most concepts are single teachable ideas. Lesson sizes vary naturally (5-8 concepts). The progression is logical from fundamentals to advanced selectivity topics. There are a few minor issues: some concept titles could be slightly more specific (e.g., 'Aldolación' is a bit bare), and a couple of concepts like 'Comparación de reactividad aldehído cetona' uses a comparison structure that borders on violating the no-comparison rule. The organocatalysis lesson and some stereochemistry concepts are well-placed within the chapter scope. Lesson descriptions mostly avoid forbidden words. The neighboring chapter filtering is well done — no obvious overlap with acid derivatives, aromatics, or other neighboring chapters. Some concepts about acylation via enolates could border on the 'ácidos carboxílicos y derivados' chapter, but they're framed through the enolate lens. Overall, this is the most complete and well-structured curriculum.",

The separation of kinetic and thermodynamic enolates into separate lessons is pedagogically sound. Some minor issues: the reduction lesson with hydrides (NaBH4, LiAlH4) could be seen as borderline overlap with a general transformations chapter, but it's framed as carbonyl chemistry. Thioacetals lesson has only 5 concepts which is fine. The chemoselectivity lesson at the end is a good addition. Lesson descriptions are mostly clean though a few could be tighter. A couple of concept titles use commas to join items (e.g., 'Iminas, iminios, enaminas' as a lesson title is fine). Good neighboring chapter awareness.

Some concept titles use 'vs.' (e.g., 'Enolatos cinéticos vs. enolatos termodinámicos', 'Alquilación en carbono vs. alquilación en oxígeno', 'Nucleófilos duros vs. blandos en adición conjugada') which violates the prompt rules.

The Robinson annulation is mentioned only as 'Secuencia en tándem de Robinson' which is vague. Concept titles are generally clean and follow the rules well. Lesson descriptions are good.

While some of these are relevant to carbonyl chemistry broadly, several represent scope creep: Baeyer-Villiger is an oxidation reaction that could belong in acid derivatives, Cannizzaro and Tischenko are niche, and the retrosynthetic analysis lesson feels like a meta-skill lesson which the prompt says to avoid.
