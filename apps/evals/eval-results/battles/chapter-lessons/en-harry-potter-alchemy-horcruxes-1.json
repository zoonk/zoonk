  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n      - Should cover each Horcrux-related concept separately\n      - Should distinguish between alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone, and Horcrux concepts\n      - Should break down moral and philosophical implications of soul fragmentation individually\n      - Even though this is pop culture, lessons should still be focused and granular\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching Legilimency, Occlumency, or memory manipulation (neighboring chapter \"Mind magic and memory\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching wand woods, cores, or the Elder Wand (neighboring chapter \"Wandlore\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching magical healing or St Mungo's (neighboring chapter \"Healing and magical medicine\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching divination methods or prophecy (neighboring chapter \"Divination and prophecy\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

The progression is logical, moving from alchemy fundamentals through immortality themes, then into Horcrux definition, creation, effects, destruction, and philosophical implications. It avoids neighboring chapter topics (no dedicated lessons on wands, healing, divination, or mind magic). It correctly avoids AND/OR/VS in titles joining separate concepts. Descriptions are crisp, 1-2 sentences, no filler. Some lessons are quite abstract/philosophical (e.g., 'Meaning under endless time,' 'Identity as immortality project') which could feel slightly beyond the chapter's direct scope, but they're defensible as explorations of 'immortality myths' and 'costs of soul fragmentation.' The model handles the comparison between Stone and Horcrux paths without combining them inappropriately. It covers Horcrux corruption, living Horcruxes, accidental Horcruxes, destruction methods, remorse, and afterlife implications—all individually. Very strong coverage of moral/philosophical dimensions broken into individual lessons. Minor weakness: a few lessons like 'Stable transformation' and 'Longevity vs invincibility' could feel slightly redundant or abstract, and it doesn't cover specific Horcrux objects (diary, locket, etc.) which is a valid scope choice but reduces concreteness.",

The progression is well-structured, moving from broad immortality themes through alchemy, the Stone, Elixir, unicorn blood, soul metaphysics, Horcrux creation, individual Horcrux behaviors/tactics, destruction methods, and philosophical consequences. Titles are concise and avoid fluff. It avoids neighboring chapter content appropriately. Particularly strong on breaking down Horcrux influence patterns (diary as text-based tactic, locket as wearable exposure, ring as temptation trap, etc.) without explicitly naming them as standalone Horcrux-object lessons—instead framing them as behavioral/tactical concepts, which is clever. The alchemical stages (Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, Rubedo) are covered, which is relevant to alchemy symbolism. Unicorn blood is covered as a parallel immortality method. Some lessons are quite abstract ('Legacy distortion,' 'Identity under immortality') but defensible. However, the opening section (lessons 1-9) on generic immortality themes before getting to alchemy feels slightly unusual in ordering and some of these lessons ('Regeneration as survival strategy,' 'Resurrection as a broken promise') feel somewhat tangential or overly abstract for the chapter scope. 'Alchemical circle meaning' and 'Laboratory as transformation space' may be stretching beyond what the chapter covers. A few descriptions verge on being too metaphorical/abstract rather than concrete. The 'Stages of the Great Work' lessons (Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, Rubedo) are relevant but Citrinitas is a deep-cut that may exceed chapter scope. Some lessons like 'Violence as upkeep' are a bit cryptic. Overall very strong but slightly over-extended in places.",

Each specific Horcrux gets its own lesson, providing good granularity on that front. Strong coverage of the moral/philosophical dimension (Flamel vs Voldemort, love as immortality, Harry's sacrifice). However, some lessons arguably combine concepts: 'Methods of Horcrux Destruction' lists three methods in one lesson (basilisk venom, Fiendfyre, Sword of Gryffindor), which could be split further. 'Immortality Myths in Real-World Folklore' is somewhat broad. The Deathly Hallows content (Tale of Three Brothers, Resurrection Stone) is arguably straying into territory that could belong elsewhere, though it's defensible as 'immortality myths.' 'Surviving the Killing Curse Again' and 'The Mangled Soul at King's Cross' are very specific plot points that are relevant but narrow.

The 'Alchemy's external approach' vs 'Horcruxes' internal approach' split is well done. However, 34 lessons feels slightly under-extensive compared to the chapter's scope. It doesn't cover individual Horcrux objects (diary, locket, etc.), specific destruction methods (basilisk venom, Fiendfyre), unicorn blood, the significance of the number seven, or the accidental Horcrux concept in detail.
