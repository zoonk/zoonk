  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n      - Even though this is pop culture, concepts should still be focused and granular\n\n      \n  # How to evaluate\n\n  You are evaluating a CURRICULUM, not a glossary. Think like a curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use domain expertise and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single, specific idea — something a domain expert would consider one teachable unit\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT teachable items that a student would need separate lessons for\n  - Use domain expertise: terms that sound broad to a generalist may be a single well-defined concept in the field\n  - Conjunctions (AND/OR/VS and equivalents in any language) signal potential broadness, but only penalize when they join genuinely separate topics — not when the comparison itself IS the concept, or when \"and\" connects an entity to its work\n  - Concept titles should be concrete and self-explanatory, not interpretive thesis statements or vague abstractions\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",

It has 17 lessons with a very high concept count, covering alchemy foundations, immortality myths, death metaphysics, alchemical operations, magnum opus stages, the Philosopher's Stone in canon and as symbol, Elixir of Life constraints, Horcrux fundamentals, creation logic, vessel strategy, canonical Horcruxes, influence mechanics, soul fragmentation costs, destruction logic, soul repair, and a contrast lesson. The granularity is excellent — concepts like 'Elixir dosing cycle', 'Elixir withdrawal death', 'Fragment extraction step', 'Container preparation step' are appropriately fine-grained. Lesson descriptions avoid filler words and go straight to content. Progression is logical from foundational metaphysics through alchemy to Horcruxes. However, there are some issues: (1) The alchemical operations lesson (Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, Coagulation) is arguably over-detailed for a Harry Potter course — these are real-world alchemy concepts with limited direct relevance to the series. (2) Some concepts like 'Ghost persistence choice' could arguably overlap with neighboring chapters, though it's framed through the death metaphysics lens. (3) 'Citrinitas stage' is included alongside Nigredo/Albedo/Rubedo — this stage is rarely discussed in HP context. (4) A few concept titles are slightly abstract ('Death obsession reinforcement', 'Proximity deterioration marker'). (5) 'Mirror of Erised selection rule' is somewhat tangential. Despite these minor issues, the coverage is the most comprehensive and the structure is the most thoughtfully organized.",

Concept titles are generally good and specific ('Fragment autonomy level', 'Horcrux sentience gradient', 'Vessel permanence value'). Lesson descriptions are well-written and avoid filler. The 'Flamel as thematic foil' lesson has concepts that are somewhat interpretive rather than factual ('Flamel as ethical immortal', 'Flamel as counterpoint to dark immortality') — these read more like thesis statements than glossary entries. Some concept titles are slightly abstract ('Immortality as narrative corruption engine', 'Violence reinforcement loop'). The contrast lesson at the end is thematic rather than introducing new concepts, which slightly violates the 'every lesson should teach new concepts' rule, though the concepts within it are distinct enough. No significant neighboring-chapter overlap. Good logical progression. Overall very strong but slightly less exhaustive than Model D and with some interpretive concept titles.",

(2) 'Character Responses to Mortality' lesson feels like it's about character analysis rather than teaching new concepts about alchemy/Horcruxes/immortality.

(6) The Nicolas Flamel lesson has 5 concepts but some are thin ('The Age of Nicolas Flamel'). (7) The Horcrux Defenses lesson is very specific to plot details rather than metaphysical concepts.
