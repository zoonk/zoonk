  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n\n      \n  # How to evaluate\n\n  You are evaluating a CURRICULUM, not a glossary. Think like a curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use domain expertise and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single, specific idea — something a domain expert would consider one teachable unit\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT teachable items that a student would need separate lessons for\n  - Use domain expertise: terms that sound broad to a generalist may be a single well-defined concept in the field\n  - Conjunctions (AND/OR/VS and equivalents in any language) signal potential broadness, but only penalize when they join genuinely separate topics — not when the comparison itself IS the concept, or when \"and\" connects an entity to its work\n  - Concept titles should be concrete and self-explanatory, not interpretive thesis statements or vague abstractions\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",

It has 21 lessons with ~150 concepts, covering IP addressing, subnetting, DHCP/SLAAC, local link delivery (ARP, MAC), routing, ICMP, NAT, ports/sockets, TCP setup, TCP teardown, TCP reliability, TCP flow control, TCP congestion control, UDP, MTU/fragmentation, latency/throughput, firewalls, misconfiguration failures, path failures, and debugging mental models. The granularity is excellent — TCP is properly broken into setup, teardown, reliability, flow control, and congestion control as separate lessons. Concepts are genuinely single-idea items (e.g., 'SYN flag', 'ACK flag', 'Initial sequence number'). Lesson sizes vary naturally (6-8). No compound concepts with AND/OR/VS. Lesson descriptions go straight to content without filler words. The progression is logical from layers → addressing → routing → protocols → performance → failures → debugging. Minor concerns: DHCP lesson could arguably be considered outside scope (though IP address assignment is relevant to IP addressing), and the Internet networking layers lesson is somewhat foundational/general. Some concepts like 'Gratuitous ARP' and 'IPv6 neighbor solicitation' are quite deep for a web development course but not wrong. No neighboring chapter overlap issues. Overall this is the most thorough and well-structured curriculum.",

Very granular treatment of topics: subnetting operations, link layer/ARP, routing mechanics, NAT types, TCP mechanisms, UDP/sockets, latency components, performance pathologies, failure modes, diagnostic tools, and troubleshooting workflows. Good concept granularity overall. Lesson descriptions avoid filler words mostly. Some concerns: A few concept titles are slightly verbose or action-oriented rather than noun-phrase style (e.g., 'Calculating network address from IP and prefix', 'Check routing table with ip route (or route)', 'Inspect ARP table with arp -a'). The 'Diagnostic tools' lesson has concepts that read more like instructions ('Check interface status with ip link / ethtool'). The last lesson 'Troubleshooting mental models and workflows' has some concepts that are more meta-skills than single concepts ('Reproduce issue and isolate one variable at a time', 'Correlate packet captures with system logs and timestamps'). VLSM and APIPA are quite deep for web dev context but acceptable. Good neighboring chapter awareness. Overall very thorough with minor title formatting issues.",

Concept titles are generally concise and well-formed. A few concerns: The lesson 'TCP Selection Criteria' has a misleading title (it's really about TCP vs UDP selection), and concepts like 'Latency sensitivity', 'Loss tolerance', 'Ordering requirement' are somewhat abstract. 'UDP application reliability' is a bit vague. The lesson 'Bidirectional Connectivity' is a creative grouping but some concepts there (like 'Stateful device') are quite vague. Some NAT concepts use abbreviations without explanation (SNAT, DNAT). Missing some depth in areas like TCP flow control details.

This violates the critical requirement that lessons with >8 concepts should be split. The prompt says 'If a group would exceed 8 concepts, split it into two lessons with more specific themes.' This is a significant structural violation. Some concepts use 'vs' ('IPv4 vs IPv6 Compatibility', 'Latency vs Bandwidth Tradeoffs') which violates the no-VS rule. 'When to Use TCP' and 'When to Use UDP' are somewhat meta rather than concrete concepts. Otherwise the content coverage is reasonable and concept granularity is mostly appropriate.

The 'TCP vs UDP Tradeoffs' lesson has concepts with 'vs' in titles ('TCP vs UDP Reliability Tradeoff', 'TCP vs UDP Overhead Tradeoff', 'TCP vs UDP Latency Tradeoff') which directly violates the no-VS rule. 'Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy' also violates this. The 'Local Development Networking' lesson contains 'Docker Networking Basics for Web Developers' which is arguably outside the chapter scope — this is more about dev tooling than networking fundamentals. 'CDN at the Network Level' and 'Load Balancer at the Network Level' could overlap with other web development chapters. 'WebRTC and UDP' is quite application-specific.
