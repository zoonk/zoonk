  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in Brazilian Portuguese\n      - Should break down architectural concepts individually (modularity, coupling, cohesion as separate lessons)\n      - Should cover fitness functions as distinct lessons\n      - Should separate evolutionary architecture theory from practical decision-making\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching DevOps pipelines, CI/CD, or infrastructure as code (neighboring chapter \"DevOps e entrega contínua\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching SLIs, SLOs, or error budgets (neighboring chapter \"SRE e confiabilidade em produtos digitais\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching technical debt management or strategic refactoring (neighboring chapter \"Dívida técnica e sustentabilidade\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching test strategies, test pyramids, or automated testing (neighboring chapter \"Estratégias modernas de testes\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

It breaks down each concept into genuinely single-concept lessons: modularity, coupling, cohesion, fitness functions, ADRs, and architectural decisions are all thoroughly decomposed. Specific strengths: (1) Coupling is broken into 7+ distinct types (temporal, shared data, synchronous, message format, implementation knowledge) — excellent granularity. (2) Coesão is split into functional, sequential, coincidental types plus signals of low cohesion. (3) Fitness functions are covered across multiple dimensions (binary, continuous, manual, automated) with practical examples like dependency rules, module size budgets, performance budgets, and startup budgets. (4) ADRs are decomposed into structure, status, context, and consequences. (5) Includes advanced concepts like afferent/efferent coupling, module instability metrics, seams, plugability, and C4 diagrams — all within scope. (6) Properly avoids neighboring chapter topics (no dedicated DevOps, SRE, testing, or tech debt lessons). (7) Titles are concise and mostly avoid 'and/or/vs'. A few minor issues: the lesson 'Refatoração arquitetural' slightly touches neighboring chapter territory but is framed through an architectural lens. 'C4 nível contexto' and 'C4 nível container' are slightly tangential but still within architecture scope. Overall, this is the most comprehensive and well-structured output.",
