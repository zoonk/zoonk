  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n      - Should break down each historical period's health challenges into separate lessons\n      - Should cover epidemics, sanitation campaigns, and health systems individually\n      - Should separate public health policy from biomedical politics\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching urbanization, housing policy, or favela politics/governance (neighboring chapter \"Cities and urban inequality\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine. IMPORTANT: Lessons about health outcomes and disease transmission mechanisms IN urban settings (e.g., overcrowding as disease vector, sanitation infrastructure gaps) ARE within scope when the focus is on health/epidemiology. Only penalize lessons primarily about urban form, housing policy, or settlement patterns rather than health mechanisms\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching environmental history, deforestation, or the Amazon (neighboring chapter \"Environmental history and the Amazon\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching military history, coups, or defense policy (neighboring chapter \"Military and national security\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching historiography, monuments, or public memory (neighboring chapter \"Historiography and public memory\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

It breaks down topics into genuinely single-concept lessons — for example, splitting the Vaccine Revolt into the event itself and its aftermath, separating miasma theory from germ theory adoption, distinguishing leprosy isolation policy from leprosy colonies, and separating tuberculosis prevention from tuberculosis sanatoriums. The progression is logical, moving from 19th-century foundations through mid-century campaigns to the SUS era and contemporary crises including COVID-19. Titles are concise and specific. Descriptions are tight, typically one sentence, and avoid fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore.' The chapter description's themes — public health, epidemics, health systems, biomedical politics, sanitation campaigns, and inequality — are all thoroughly covered. It appropriately handles neighboring chapters: urban settings are referenced through health lenses (e.g., 'Coercive health policing,' 'Sanitation infrastructure as health policy') without teaching urbanization per se. It covers important topics others miss: DDT, wartime public health expansion, SESP, eugenics, racialized medicine, venereal disease politics, maternalism, infant mortality campaigns, asylum psychiatry, anti-asylum movement, health bureaucracy growth, community medicine pilots, generic drug policy, dengue resurgence, gendered impacts of Zika, Indigenous health subsystem, Indigenous health barriers, carceral health crisis, violence as a health metric, austerity and SUS capacity, hospital surge capacity, COVID-19 surveillance politics, COVID-19 distancing policy, pandemic federalism, unproven therapies, vaccine procurement, health misinformation, excess mortality, inequality in pandemic outcomes, and COVID-19 memory politics. A minor concern: 'COVID-19 memory politics' edges toward the neighboring 'Historiography and public memory' chapter, but its description focuses on pandemic-era competing narratives rather than formal historiography. Overall the most complete and well-structured output.",

The descriptions are well-written and focused, avoiding fluff. Titles are concise. The logical progression is solid. It covers 'biomedical politics' thoroughly with lessons on biomedical authority, protocols as political instruments, biomedical innovation pipeline, emergency powers, and media framing. Some lessons push toward neighboring chapter territory: 'Territorial stigma in health policy' and 'Community responses to COVID-19' (favela mutual aid) edge toward the 'Cities and urban inequality' chapter, though the descriptions keep health focus. A few titles use 'as' constructions that could arguably be split but generally represent single analytical concepts. The coverage of sanitation campaigns, inequality axes (race, gender, Indigenous, carceral), and the full SUS ecosystem is thorough. Minor weaknesses: some lessons feel slightly abstract/conceptual rather than historically grounded (e.g., 'Protocols as political instruments,' 'Biomedical innovation pipeline'), and a few could be more specific in their Brazilian historical anchoring.

Some titles use 'and' joining genuinely separate concepts: 'Sanitarism vs. Eugenics,' 'Race, Class, and Epidemic Blame,' 'Zika, Gender, and Reproductive Rights.' Some descriptions are longer than ideal for the format. The 'Health Inequality as a Structural Pattern' final lesson reads like a summary/review lesson, which violates the rules. The Bolsonaro-specific political framing in several lessons edges toward political narrative rather than health policy analysis, though this is a minor concern.
