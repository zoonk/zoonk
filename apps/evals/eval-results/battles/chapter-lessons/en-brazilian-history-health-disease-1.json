Think like a curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use domain expertise and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single, specific idea — something a domain expert would consider one teachable unit\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT teachable items that a student would need separate lessons for\n  - Use domain expertise: terms that sound broad to a generalist may be a single well-defined concept in the field\n  - Conjunctions (AND/OR/VS and equivalents in any language) signal potential broadness, but only penalize when they join genuinely separate topics — not when the comparison itself IS the concept, or when \"and\" connects an entity to its work\n  - Concept titles should be concrete and self-explanatory, not interpretive thesis statements or vague abstractions\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",

Key strengths: (1) Excellent chronological progression from colonial era through COVID-19; (2) Granularity is consistently strong — concepts like 'Compulsory Licensing of AIDS Drugs', 'P.1 Gamma Variant Origin in Manaus', 'Austerity Amendment EC 95 (2016) and Health Spending Cap' are appropriately specific; (3) Covers topics others miss: eugenics, the 1918 flu in detail, austerity post-2016, leprosy/leishmaniasis/schistosomiasis, mental health reform, reproductive health, the Vargas era; (4) Lesson sizes vary naturally (6-8 concepts); (5) Lesson descriptions follow the rules well — mostly avoiding 'introduces/presents' language. Minor weaknesses: The COVID-19 lesson has 11 concepts (exceeds the 8-concept limit and should be split); a few concepts use 'and' ('Doria vs. Bolsonaro Vaccine Dispute' uses 'vs.'); 'SUS Principles: Universality, Equity, Integrality' bundles three principles into one concept. Some concepts border on neighboring chapter territory (e.g., 'Olympic Games and Zika Risk Debate' could arguably overlap with Sports chapter, but it's framed through health).
