Think like a curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use domain expertise and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single, specific idea — something a domain expert would consider one teachable unit\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT teachable items that a student would need separate lessons for\n  - Use domain expertise: terms that sound broad to a generalist may be a single well-defined concept in the field\n  - Conjunctions (AND/OR/VS and equivalents in any language) signal potential broadness, but only penalize when they join genuinely separate topics — not when the comparison itself IS the concept, or when \"and\" connects an entity to its work\n  - Concept titles should be concrete and self-explanatory, not interpretive thesis statements or vague abstractions\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Neighboring chapters are guardrails against scope creep, not vetoes.\n\n  The key principle: **judge by framing, not by keywords.** A concept belongs in THIS chapter if its primary teaching purpose serves THIS chapter's learning goals — even if the concept mentions words that appear in a neighboring chapter's title. Ask: \"What is this concept primarily TEACHING?\" not \"Does this concept MENTION a neighboring topic?\"\n\n  When in doubt, favor the chapter description. If a concept is framed through this chapter's lens and serves its learning goals, it is in-scope.\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise and go straight to the content — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\", \"explores\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - Should follow the specified language (proper nouns and established technical terms may remain in their original language)\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity? Don't penalize for fewer concepts if the chapter's scope is inherently narrow.\n\n  ## Proportionality\n\n  Weight your scoring proportionally. A curriculum that covers the chapter exhaustively with good structure but has a few overly-broad concept titles is fundamentally different from one that misses entire topics or systematically violates scope. Minor title-phrasing issues should not dominate the score when the overall curriculum quality is strong.\n\n    ",

The concept count is high (~80+) and appropriately granular — each concept is a single teachable idea. Lesson sizes vary naturally (6-8). Lesson descriptions go straight to content without filler words. The titles are concrete and self-explanatory. A few minor notes: 'Valores True' and 'Valores False' are slightly awkward phrasing in Portuguese. The separation of inf/NaN into its own lesson is well done. The 'Interações entre tipos numéricos em expressões' lesson covers mixing types well but has 8 concepts, some of which could arguably be combined (e.g., 'Mistura de Decimal e float em operações' is really about an error case). No neighboring chapter overlap issues. Coverage is thorough. No compound concepts with AND/OR/VS. The progression is logical. Missing some minor items like math.fsum(), cmath module, float methods like as_integer_ratio(), but these are minor gaps. Overall very strong.",

The 'Booleanos e None' lesson bundles two distinct topics into one lesson with only 6 concepts, missing important details like comparison with is, truthy/falsy, differences between None and other falsy values. Missing entirely: rounding/truncation functions (math.floor, math.ceil, math.trunc), type coercion rules, math.isclose() details, literal syntax details (underscore separator), type inspection (type(), isinstance()). Some concept titles are vague: 'Valor Não numérico' could be more specific, 'Conversão para Inteiro' is too broad. The lesson descriptions are acceptable but not exceptional.

Some concepts like 'Operações aritméticas com Decimal', 'Operações aritméticas com Fraction', and 'Operações aritméticas com complexos' are too broad — they could each be broken into specific operations. However, the inclusion of a 'Métodos dos Tipos int e float' lesson with bit_length(), bit_count(), to_bytes(), from_bytes(), is_integer(), hex(), fromhex(), as_integer_ratio() is excellent and goes beyond what most other models covered. The 'Funções Numéricas Essenciais' lesson is well-structured. Truthy/falsy concepts may border on neighboring chapter territory (Controle de fluxo) but are framed through the bool type lens which is appropriate. The cmath module inclusion is good. Lesson descriptions occasionally start with 'O tipo...' which is fine — they don't use forbidden words. Coverage is thorough.

The 'Hierarquia numérica abstrata (numbers)' concept in the coercion lesson adds valuable depth. Coverage of None, bool, conversions, and rounding is thorough. The lesson on fractions includes limit_denominator() which some models miss. Some concerns: 'Aritmética exata com Decimal' is somewhat broad — what specific aspect of arithmetic? 'Aritmética exata com frações' has the same issue. 'Aritmética com booleanos' is broad. 'Aritmética com números complexos' is also broad. The lesson descriptions are good and don't use forbidden words. The concept 'Comportamento de NaN em comparações' is well-scoped. 'O módulo cmath' as a single concept is a bit broad but acceptable as an awareness-level item.

Some concepts are well-granulated (e.g., 'Exemplo 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3', 'ULP (unit in last place)'). The inclusion of math.fsum() is a nice detail that most others miss. However, some concepts are compound: 'None como ausência de valor' is bundled with bool in the same lesson with only 7 concepts, which is acceptable but could be better separated. The 'Imutabilidade de int' concept is interesting but may be too brief for a standalone concept.

However, this level of detail raises concerns: it goes beyond what the chapter description calls for in several areas. Having separate lessons for 'Condições sinalizadas no Decimal' and 'Traps do contexto Decimal' with 6-8 concepts each is extremely deep — most Python courses wouldn't cover individual trap flags as separate concepts. The 'Torre numérica do Python' lesson with numbers.Number, numbers.Integral, etc. is quite advanced and may not be essential. Some lessons have fewer than 3 concepts after removing overlaps. The 'Componentes exatos de números' lesson feels like a grab-bag. Some concepts are extremely narrow (e.g., 'Campo digits em DecimalTuple', 'Parâmetro capitals do contexto Decimal'). While thoroughness is valued, some of this feels like reference documentation rather than curriculum. Lesson descriptions are well-written and avoid forbidden words. No AND/OR/VS violations noticed. The coverage is certainly exhaustive, perhaps excessively so for the scope implied by the chapter description. Missing literal bases (binary, octal, hex literals) which is a gap.
