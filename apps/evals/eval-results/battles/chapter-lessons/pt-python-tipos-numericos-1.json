  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in Brazilian Portuguese\n      - Should break down each numeric type into separate lessons (int, float, complex, bool, None)\n      - Should cover precision and rounding as individual concepts\n      - Should separate type conversions from arithmetic operations\n      - Operations and methods on numeric types (e.g., bitwise ops on int, cmath functions for complex, Decimal/Fraction methods) ARE within scope — these are behaviors of the numeric types themselves. Only penalize if a lesson's primary focus is a data structure or I/O concept that merely uses numbers as an example\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching installation, virtual environments, or IDE setup (neighboring chapter \"Ambiente de desenvolvimento\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching indentation rules, naming conventions, or docstrings (neighboring chapter \"Sintaxe e convenções\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching strings, bytes, or Unicode encoding (neighboring chapter \"Texto e codificação\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n      - Should NOT create dedicated lessons teaching lists, tuples, dictionaries, or sets (neighboring chapter \"Estruturas de dados fundamentais\" covers that) — brief contextual references are fine\n\n      \n  - Each lesson should cover a SINGLE, SPECIFIC concept that can be explained within 10 short tweets\n  - Break down topics into the smallest, most manageable units possible, so that each lesson can be learned in 2-3 minutes\n  - If a topic is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson should be extremely focused on a SINGLE concept\n  - If a lesson is too broad, split it into multiple lessons\n  - Each lesson must cover a SINGLE concept. Using \"AND\", \"OR\", \"VS\" (or equivalents in other languages like \"e\", \"ou\", \"y\", \"o\") in a title is a signal it MAY be too broad — but it is acceptable when the comparison or pairing IS the concept itself (e.g., \"DEPT-90 y DEPT-135\" where distinguishing two NMR techniques is the lesson, or \"IPv4 vs. IPv6 Format\" where the format contrast is one concept). Only penalize when AND/OR/VS joins genuinely separate concepts that deserve their own lessons (e.g., \"Strings and Lists\" where each is a full topic)\n  - Lesson titles should be short and specific to the exact concept covered\n  - Build a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts\n  - Ensure lessons build on knowledge from previous lessons\n  - Focus lessons for this specific chapter, not the entire course\n  - Don't include summary or review lessons. For example, do NOT create a lesson title \"Summary of Key Concepts\" or \"Review of Chapter\"\n  - Don't include assessment or quiz lessons\n  - Don't include final project or capstone lessons\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words (avoid \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", \"introduction to\", etc.)\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the lesson content quality\n  - Include an extensive list of lessons to fully cover the chapter's scope. The key metric is completeness: are all concepts in the chapter description adequately covered with sufficient granularity? Broad technical chapters (e.g., web fundamentals, Python basics) typically need 80-120+ lessons. Narrower or more specialized chapters (e.g., legal theory of evidence, NMR spectroscopy) may need fewer if the domain is inherently smaller — do not penalize for fewer lessons if the chapter's scope is fully covered\n\n  Neighboring chapter scope judgment:\n  - The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what is in-scope. Neighboring chapter constraints are guardrails against scope creep, NOT vetoes over topics listed in the chapter description\n  - If a topic is explicitly mentioned in the chapter description, it is in-scope even if it touches on a neighboring chapter's domain (e.g., \"Claisen\" listed in a carbonyls chapter is in-scope even though esters have their own chapter)\n  - The key test: does a lesson teach a topic AS ITS OWN SUBJECT (violation) or through the LENS OF THIS CHAPTER (acceptable)? Documenting empirical patterns/observations of X within this chapter's context is NOT the same as teaching X's theory (e.g., documenting consumption's cyclical behavior is a business cycle fact, not consumption theory)\n  - When a lesson's title mentions a neighboring topic, read the description to determine focus. A lesson titled \"Cortiços as disease ecologies\" focused on disease transmission is health content, not urbanization content\n\n  Things to check:\n  - Is each lesson too broad? If so, it should be broken down further\n  - Can each concept be explained in 10 short tweets or less? If not, it should be broken down\n  - Does each lesson focus on a single specific concept? If not, it should be split\n  - Does it have lessons that don't belong in this chapter? If so, they should be removed\n\n    ",

It includes sys.float_info, sys.int_info, -0.0, and other nuanced topics that demonstrate thorough coverage. Some minor issues: a few lessons might be slightly narrow (e.g., separate lessons for True as 1 and False as 0), and 'Decimal: rounding modes' uses English in the title, but these are minor.
