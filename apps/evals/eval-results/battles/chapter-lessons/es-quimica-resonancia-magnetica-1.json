The lessons are well-separated into single concepts, follow logical progression, avoid neighboring chapter topics, use concise Spanish descriptions, and avoid forbidden words. Titles are specific and focused. Minor issues: a few titles like 'Acoplamientos 1J 2J 3J' and 'A través de enlaces' could be more descriptive, and the last title is vague. Some lessons are borderline too narrow (HDO signal, zero of integration) but this is better than too broad. Overall the best balance of extensiveness, granularity, and adherence to prompt rules.",

Structural elucidation is broken into specific steps. It also covers DOSY, J-resolved, coalescence, and dynamic processes. Very good adherence to single-concept focus. Minor issues: some lessons feel repetitive (e.g., multiple lessons on NOESY contacts), a few titles could be more specific ('Promedio químico'), and the title 'NOESY frente a ROESY' technically uses a comparison but this is acceptable for distinguishing techniques. Does not violate neighboring chapter constraints. Very strong overall but slightly less organized than Model C in the structural elucidation section.",

The lessons are well-structured with good logical progression from fundamentals through chemical shift, integration, coupling, DEPT, 2D techniques, and structural elucidation. Descriptions are concise and informative. However, 49 lessons is significantly fewer than expected for this complex chapter — the prompt asks for extensive coverage and the expectations mention complex topics usually require 100+ lessons. Several topics are under-developed: coupling could be broken down more (no separate lessons for individual multiplet types, no aromatic J patterns), integration lacks detail on practical considerations, no coverage of relaxation (T1/T2), no instrumentation details (FID, FT), no mention of DOSY or J-resolved, limited coverage of practical aspects. Title 'Anisotropía magnética: alquenos, alquinos y carbonilos' violates the 'AND' rule. 'NOESY frente a ROESY' uses comparison phrasing. Some lessons like 'Efectos del solvente y temperatura en el desplazamiento químico' combine two concepts. Good quality but insufficient extensiveness.",

The 'Ejemplo de elucidación estructural completa' lesson is essentially a worked example that might exceed 2-3 minutes scope.

Missing DOSY, J-resolved, DEPT-90 details, equivalence types, aromatic coupling patterns, shift reagents.
