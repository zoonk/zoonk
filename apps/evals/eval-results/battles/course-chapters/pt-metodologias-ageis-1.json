  "expectations": "\n      - It's fine (and expected) to mention popular frameworks like Scrum and Kanban as part of the methodologies\n      - MUST be in Brazilian Portuguese\n\n      \n  - It should assume learners start with no prior knowledge of the subject\n  - Should create a progressive learning path going from basic/beginner to mastery of the subject\n  - By the end of this course, they should be able to lead very complex projects and tasks in this field\n  - They should be prepared for certifications or advanced studies in this subject like a master's degree or PhD\n  - Should include **EVERYTHING** a student needs to be at the top 1% of the field\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Should cover latest trends in the field\n  - Don't use vendors in chapter titles or descriptions (e.g. \"npm\", \"yarn\", \"Redux\", etc.)\n    - Except are for widely known tools related to the course (e.g. \"Git\" in a programming course)\n  - This is an eval system for a learning platform, of course the definition of \"ready for a job\" doesn't mean they have the legal requirements to work in the field (eg. medical license, law license, etc.). That's not important here, we're assessing if the course prepares the student with the necessary knowledge and skills.\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the chapter content quality.\n  - Titles should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - Just \"HTML\" is better than \"HTML Structure and Semantics\" (structure and semantics are implied if this is the only HTML chapter). Similarly, if we only have one CSS chapter, just \"CSS\" is better than \"CSS Styling and Layout\".\n    - \"Front-end frameworks\" is better than \"Front-End UI Frameworks Overview\" (too verbose) or \"Front-End Frameworks: Core Concepts\" (core concepts is unnecessary fluff)\n    - \"Relational Databases\" is better than \"Relational Databases and SQL\" (SQL is implied, no need to mention)\n    - \"Introduction to Java\" is better than \"Introduction to Java and Setting Up Your Development Environment\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Lean Startup\" is better than \"The Lean Startup Methodology: An Overview\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Introduction to X\" is valid for titles of introductory chapters but we should avoid those words in descriptions\n  - Similarly, descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - \"Styling with CSS: Selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" is better than \"Master styling and layout with CSS, including selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" - \"Master\" is fluff, and so are words like \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", etc.\n    - \"Properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" is better than \"Explore the definition of Chemistry, properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" - \"Explore the definition of Chemistry\" are filler/unnecessary words.\n  - Don't add capstone/final projects, assessments, or exercises\n  - It shouldn't mention in title or description references to 1% or similar instructions about being top 1%\n\n    ",

(2) Titles are concise and follow guidelines well (e.g., 'Empirismo', 'Kanban: fundamentos', 'TDD'). (3) Descriptions are straight to the point without filler words like 'learn' or 'explore'. (4) Excellent granularity - Scrum gets ~15 chapters, Kanban gets ~10, XP gets appropriate coverage. (5) Covers advanced topics like DDD, fitness functions, observability, DevSecOps, data quality, antifragility. (6) Career chapter included. (7) All in Brazilian Portuguese. (8) Vendor neutral with appropriate exceptions. (9) Covers latest trends including AI, MLOps, and remote work. Minor weaknesses: some chapters could be seen as too engineering-focused for a 'Metodologias Ágeis' course, and a few descriptions are slightly verbose, but overall this is the most complete and well-balanced curriculum.",

(3) The last chapter 'Síntese e Integração de Práticas Ágeis' feels like a capstone. (4) Chapter count is lower than Models D and B, meaning some topics get less granular treatment.

Weaknesses: (1) Descriptions are generally in Portuguese but several chapter titles and descriptions feel more like English translations than natural Portuguese ('Agile Procurement', 'Knowledge Management e Playbooks').
