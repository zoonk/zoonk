That's not important here, we're assessing if the course prepares the student with the necessary knowledge and skills.\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the chapter content quality.\n  - Titles should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - Just \"HTML\" is better than \"HTML Structure and Semantics\" (structure and semantics are implied if this is the only HTML chapter). Similarly, if we only have one CSS chapter, just \"CSS\" is better than \"CSS Styling and Layout\".\n    - \"Front-end frameworks\" is better than \"Front-End UI Frameworks Overview\" (too verbose) or \"Front-End Frameworks: Core Concepts\" (core concepts is unnecessary fluff)\n    - \"Relational Databases\" is better than \"Relational Databases and SQL\" (SQL is implied, no need to mention)\n    - \"Introduction to Java\" is better than \"Introduction to Java and Setting Up Your Development Environment\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Lean Startup\" is better than \"The Lean Startup Methodology: An Overview\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Introduction to X\" is valid for titles of introductory chapters but we should avoid those words in descriptions\n  - Similarly, descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - \"Styling with CSS: Selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" is better than \"Master styling and layout with CSS, including selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" - \"Master\" is fluff, and so are words like \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", etc.\n    - \"Properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" is better than \"Explore the definition of Chemistry, properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" - \"Explore the definition of Chemistry\" are filler/unnecessary words.\n  - Don't add capstone/final projects, assessments, or exercises\n  - It shouldn't mention in title or description references to 1% or similar instructions about being top 1%\n\n    ",

It also covers modern/frontier topics like digital economy, privacy economics, crypto/DeFi, geoeconomics (missing though), behavioral macro, expectations/information frictions, heterogeneous-agent models, spatial equilibrium, firm dynamics, productivity measurement, culture and economics, gender economics, race and economics, intergenerational economics, aging economics. The titles are generally concise and follow the prompt guidelines well. Descriptions are direct without filler words. It includes career chapters plus graduate study preparation and interview preparation. It covers data management, reproducibility, visualization, computational methods, and text-as-data. Some minor issues: having separate chapters for 'simple regression' and 'multiple regression' plus 'robust inference' is very granular on basic econometrics; a few chapters like 'Crypto and DeFi economics' are somewhat niche. It includes chapters on philosophy of economics, history of economic thought, and ethics. The math foundations section (calculus, linear algebra, optimization, dynamic programming, optimal control) is thorough. Overall, this is the most complete and well-structured curriculum.",

Titles are concise and professional. Descriptions avoid filler. It covers nowcasting, forecasting, economic communication, ethics, and careers. Some gaps: mathematical foundations are less explicit (constrained optimization and probability are covered but no dedicated linear algebra, calculus, or dynamic programming chapters).

It has excellent research skills coverage including grant writing, presentation skills, and replication standards. However, there are some issues: some titles are verbose (e.g., 'Mathematical Foundations II: Multivariable Calculus & Optimization', 'Game Theory III: Incomplete Information and Signaling'), which goes against the concise title guideline. Several chapters use 'Special Topics in...' framing which is somewhat vague.
