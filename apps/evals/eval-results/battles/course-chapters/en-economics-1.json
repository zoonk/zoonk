That's not important here, we're assessing if the course prepares the student with the necessary knowledge and skills.\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the chapter content quality.\n  - Titles should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - Just \"HTML\" is better than \"HTML Structure and Semantics\" (structure and semantics are implied if this is the only HTML chapter). Similarly, if we only have one CSS chapter, just \"CSS\" is better than \"CSS Styling and Layout\".\n    - \"Front-end frameworks\" is better than \"Front-End UI Frameworks Overview\" (too verbose) or \"Front-End Frameworks: Core Concepts\" (core concepts is unnecessary fluff)\n    - \"Relational Databases\" is better than \"Relational Databases and SQL\" (SQL is implied, no need to mention)\n    - \"Introduction to Java\" is better than \"Introduction to Java and Setting Up Your Development Environment\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Lean Startup\" is better than \"The Lean Startup Methodology: An Overview\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Introduction to X\" is valid for titles of introductory chapters but we should avoid those words in descriptions\n  - Similarly, descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - \"Styling with CSS: Selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" is better than \"Master styling and layout with CSS, including selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" - \"Master\" is fluff, and so are words like \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", etc.\n    - \"Properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" is better than \"Explore the definition of Chemistry, properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" - \"Explore the definition of Chemistry\" are filler/unnecessary words.\n  - Don't add capstone/final projects, assessments, or exercises\n  - It shouldn't mention in title or description references to 1% or similar instructions about being top 1%\n\n    ",

(2) Strong coverage of applied fields: health, education, crime, family/gender, demography, real estate, energy — all as separate chapters. (3) Good separation of micro theory topics (preferences/choice, uncertainty, intertemporal choice). (4) Excellent macro coverage including heterogeneous-agent macro, search/matching, financial crises, and nowcasting. (5) Proper mathematical foundations placed logically. (6) Strong on methodology (philosophy of economics, research writing). (7) Concise titles that follow the prompt guidelines well — lowercase, short, no fluff. (8) Descriptions are clean and direct, no filler words. (9) Career chapter included. (10) Covers platforms/networks, innovation, measurement economics, and other frontier topics. Minor weaknesses: could have slightly more on international monetary systems/architecture, and some topics like economics of aging/pensions are missing as standalone chapters. The ordering puts math/stats in the middle which is defensible but slightly unusual. Overall, this is the most complete and well-calibrated curriculum.",
