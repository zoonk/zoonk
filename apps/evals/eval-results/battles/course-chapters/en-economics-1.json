  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n\n      \n  - It should assume learners start with no prior knowledge of the subject\n  - Should create a progressive learning path going from basic/beginner to mastery of the subject\n  - By the end of this course, they should be able to lead very complex projects and tasks in this field\n  - They should be prepared for certifications or advanced studies in this subject like a master's degree or PhD\n  - Should include **EVERYTHING** a student needs to be at the top 1% of the field\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Should cover latest trends in the field\n  - Prefer concept names over vendor names in chapter titles/descriptions (e.g., \"Package management\" instead of \"npm\"). Ecosystem-level tools (npm, yarn, Redux, Zustand) should be avoided in titles\n    - Exception: foundational tools that ARE the course subject matter are allowed (e.g., \"Git\" in a programming course, \"Node.js\" in a web dev course, \"Docker\" in a DevOps course). The test: would a chapter about this subject be incomplete without mentioning this tool?\n    - Vendor name usage is a minor issue — it affects title quality but not pedagogical content. Do NOT treat it as a major error\n  - This is an eval system for a learning platform, of course the definition of \"ready for a job\" doesn't mean they have the legal requirements to work in the field (eg. medical license, law license, etc.). That's not important here, we're assessing if the course prepares the student with the necessary knowledge and skills.\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the chapter content quality.\n  - Titles should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - Just \"HTML\" is better than \"HTML Structure and Semantics\" (structure and semantics are implied if this is the only HTML chapter). Similarly, if we only have one CSS chapter, just \"CSS\" is better than \"CSS Styling and Layout\".\n    - \"Front-end frameworks\" is better than \"Front-End UI Frameworks Overview\" (too verbose) or \"Front-End Frameworks: Core Concepts\" (core concepts is unnecessary fluff)\n    - \"Relational Databases\" is better than \"Relational Databases and SQL\" (SQL is implied, no need to mention)\n    - \"Introduction to Java\" is better than \"Introduction to Java and Setting Up Your Development Environment\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Lean Startup\" is better than \"The Lean Startup Methodology: An Overview\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Introduction to X\" is valid for titles of introductory chapters but we should avoid those words in descriptions\n  - Similarly, descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - \"Styling with CSS: Selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" is better than \"Master styling and layout with CSS, including selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" - \"Master\" is fluff, and so are words like \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", etc.\n    - \"Properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" is better than \"Explore the definition of Chemistry, properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" - \"Explore the definition of Chemistry\" are filler/unnecessary words.\n  - Don't add assessment-style chapters: no final projects, capstone assignments, exercises, quizzes, or \"test your knowledge\" chapters. A theoretical synthesis chapter (e.g., \"Design Patterns in Architecture\") is fine even if it synthesizes prior material — the rule targets assessment/project chapters, not synthesis of knowledge. If a chapter uses the word \"capstone\" but is theoretical (not an assignment), treat it as a minor issue at most, not a major error\n  - It shouldn't mention in title or description references to 1% or similar instructions about being top 1%\n\n    ",

Titles are concise and professional. Descriptions are straight to the point without filler words. It separates topics that other models combine (e.g., separate chapters for auctions, mechanism design, matching, contract theory rather than lumping them together). It includes modern topics like platform economics, digital economy, agent-based models, and reproducible research. Minor issues: some descriptions could be slightly more concise, and having both 'Data quality and measurement error' and 'Economic measurement and data' early on is slightly redundant. But overall this is the strongest curriculum.",

It also covers policy evaluation, network economics, philosophy of economics, history of thought, and careers. Titles are generally concise. Descriptions mostly avoid filler. Some strengths: includes housing economics, crime economics, family/gender economics, managerial economics, and survey design. However, the ordering is somewhat unusual — math chapters (dynamic optimization, Lagrangians, statistics) appear quite late in the curriculum (chapters 60-62), which is pedagogically questionable since these are foundational and should come early. This is a structural flaw in the progression. Also has some redundancy (e.g., 'Market failures and policy toolkits' is somewhat redundant with 'Externalities and public goods'). The 'Current research directions' chapter title is a bit generic. Overall very strong but the ordering issue is notable.",

Titles are generally clear though some are slightly verbose (e.g., 'Econometrics: Bayesian and Machine Learning Methods' combines two distinct topics). The inclusion of 'Supply Chain and Logistics Economics' is unusual for an economics curriculum and feels more like operations management. 'Digital and Crypto Economics' as a standalone chapter is reasonable but slightly trendy. Has good coverage of advanced theory chapters at the end (advanced micro, macro, econometric theory). Some descriptions use words like 'foundations needed for' which borders on filler. The 'Frontiers and Emerging Topics' chapter is a reasonable catch-all.

The econometrics section, while covering the main methods, lacks the granularity needed for mastery (e.g., no separate chapters for RDD, structural econometrics, Bayesian methods).

However, there are several issues: (1) The 'Capstone technical toolkit' chapter at the end violates the no-assessment/capstone rule — while the description is about assembling tools rather than a project, using 'Capstone' in the title and describing 'assembling pipelines' and 'curated set of datasets and scripts' makes it feel like a project chapter. (2) The curriculum is heavily skewed toward technical/quantitative methods at the expense of applied economics fields — it lacks chapters on education economics (wait, it has one), demographics, gender economics, crime economics, agricultural economics, and energy economics. (3) Some chapters feel more like a data science/CS curriculum than economics (e.g., 'Data Engineering for Economists,' 'Computational Foundations' with data structures and algorithms).
