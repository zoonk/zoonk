  "expectations": "\n      - MUST be in US English\n      - Can mention Google Cloud vendor since this is a vendor-specific course, so it's an exception to the rule of not using vendors.\n\n      \n  - It should assume learners start with no prior knowledge of the subject\n  - Should create a progressive learning path going from basic/beginner to mastery of the subject\n  - By the end of this course, they should be able to lead very complex projects and tasks in this field\n  - They should be prepared for certifications or advanced studies in this subject like a master's degree or PhD\n  - Should include **EVERYTHING** a student needs to be at the top 1% of the field\n  - Should follow the language specified by language parameter\n  - Should follow title and description guidelines: no fluff, be concise, straight to the point\n  - Should cover latest trends in the field\n  - Prefer concept names over vendor names in chapter titles/descriptions (e.g., \"Package management\" instead of \"npm\"). Ecosystem-level tools (npm, yarn, Redux, Zustand) should be avoided in titles\n    - Exception: foundational tools that ARE the course subject matter are allowed (e.g., \"Git\" in a programming course, \"Node.js\" in a web dev course, \"Docker\" in a DevOps course). The test: would a chapter about this subject be incomplete without mentioning this tool?\n    - Vendor name usage is a minor issue — it affects title quality but not pedagogical content. Do NOT treat it as a major error\n  - This is an eval system for a learning platform, of course the definition of \"ready for a job\" doesn't mean they have the legal requirements to work in the field (eg. medical license, law license, etc.). That's not important here, we're assessing if the course prepares the student with the necessary knowledge and skills.\n  - You don't need to evaluate the output format here, just focus on the chapter content quality.\n  - Titles should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - Just \"HTML\" is better than \"HTML Structure and Semantics\" (structure and semantics are implied if this is the only HTML chapter). Similarly, if we only have one CSS chapter, just \"CSS\" is better than \"CSS Styling and Layout\".\n    - \"Front-end frameworks\" is better than \"Front-End UI Frameworks Overview\" (too verbose) or \"Front-End Frameworks: Core Concepts\" (core concepts is unnecessary fluff)\n    - \"Relational Databases\" is better than \"Relational Databases and SQL\" (SQL is implied, no need to mention)\n    - \"Introduction to Java\" is better than \"Introduction to Java and Setting Up Your Development Environment\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Lean Startup\" is better than \"The Lean Startup Methodology: An Overview\" (too verbose)\n    - \"Introduction to X\" is valid for titles of introductory chapters but we should avoid those words in descriptions\n  - Similarly, descriptions should be concise and straight to the point, no fluff/filler words. For example:\n    - \"Styling with CSS: Selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" is better than \"Master styling and layout with CSS, including selectors, properties, the box model, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and cascade principles.\" - \"Master\" is fluff, and so are words like \"learn\", \"understand\", \"explore\", etc.\n    - \"Properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" is better than \"Explore the definition of Chemistry, properties of matter, states, and phase transitions.\" - \"Explore the definition of Chemistry\" are filler/unnecessary words.\n  - Don't add assessment-style chapters: no final projects, capstone assignments, exercises, quizzes, or \"test your knowledge\" chapters. A theoretical synthesis chapter (e.g., \"Design Patterns in Architecture\") is fine even if it synthesizes prior material — the rule targets assessment/project chapters, not synthesis of knowledge. If a chapter uses the word \"capstone\" but is theoretical (not an assignment), treat it as a minor issue at most, not a major error\n  - It shouldn't mention in title or description references to 1% or similar instructions about being top 1%\n\n    ",

Key strengths: (1) Exceptional granularity — networking alone is broken into 13 chapters covering VPC fundamentals, routing/firewalling, DNS, multiple load balancing chapters, egress design, network segmentation, hybrid/multi-cloud networking, edge security, network threat detection, and network monitoring. This level of depth is appropriate for mastery. (2) Excellent coverage of identity topics with separate chapters for IAM, service accounts/workload identity, advanced IAM governance, enterprise identity/SSO, customer identity, org policy, and audit logging. (3) Strong data/analytics coverage with separate chapters for BigQuery fundamentals and optimization, streaming ingestion/CDC, batch ingestion, Dataflow, Dataproc, Dataplex, Cloud Composer, analytics engineering, Looker, and data sharing. (4) AI/ML is well covered with overview, Vertex AI fundamentals, training at scale, deployment, MLOps, generative AI/RAG, responsible AI, and AI/HPC infrastructure. (5) Security is thoroughly broken down into foundations, encryption, secrets, SCC, compute/container security, data access controls, perimeter security, DLP, security operations, and compliance. (6) Includes important topics others miss like enterprise landing zones, platform concepts/control plane, developer tooling, SDKs, sustainability, supply chain security, AlloyDB, database migration, and SAP workloads. (7) Descriptions are concise and follow prompt guidelines — no fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore'. (8) Titles are generally clean and professional. (9) Logical progression from fundamentals through specialized topics. (10) Career chapter included. Minor issues: some titles could be slightly more concise, and there are a couple of vendor-specific tool mentions in titles (like 'Cloud Run', 'Cloud Functions') but since this is a Google Cloud course, that's expected and explicitly allowed.",
