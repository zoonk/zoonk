  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: DNA transcription involves specific molecular machinery moving along the DNA strand. Penalize if:\n   - RNA polymerase is described as copying both DNA strands simultaneously (it reads one template strand)\n   - The process confuses transcription with translation (transcription produces mRNA; translation produces proteins)\n\n2. DEPTH CHECK: Penalize if the process is presented as simply \"DNA is copied to RNA\" without showing the unwinding, reading, and assembly happening in sequence.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT RNA polymerase, nucleotides, and promoters ARE. This should show HOW they move, bind, assemble, and release in the active process.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. FACTUAL ACCURACY: Any process descriptions, mechanisms, or cause-effect relationships must be correct. Penalize hallucinations, incorrect sequences, or wrong causal chains.\n\n2. PROCESS FOCUS: Content must show things HAPPENING, not just describe parts. Look for action verbs, cause-effect language, and sequential flow.\n\n3. DEPTH: Complex processes require multi-step explanations showing how one action triggers the next. Penalize oversimplified \"just happens\" explanations.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like giving a behind-the-scenes tour. Include process metaphors from everyday life (assembly lines, relay races, domino chains).\n\n6. FOCUS: Explains HOW something works (processes in action), not WHAT it is (definitions) or WHY it exists (history).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing process phases or steps you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of steps\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" process description\n- ONLY penalize for: factual errors, static descriptions instead of action-oriented content, missing cause-effect relationships, or poor process flow\n- Different valid process explanations exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
