  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Plate tectonics involves specific geological mechanisms and processes. Penalize if:\n   - The mantle is described as liquid (it is solid rock that flows very slowly over geological time)\n\n2. DEPTH CHECK: Penalize if the explanation presents plate tectonics as simply \"continents moving\" without showing the driving mechanisms and how different boundary types create different geological features.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM BACKGROUND: The background covered the continental puzzle and Wegener's theory. This should explain how plate tectonics actually works as a mechanism.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. FACTUAL ACCURACY: Any scientific processes, mechanisms, or technical details must be correct. Penalize hallucinations, made-up components, or incorrect cause-effect relationships.\n\n2. DEPTH: Complex topics require multi-layered explanations. Penalize superficial overviews that skip essential mechanisms.\n\n3. CLARITY: Steps should build understanding progressively, explaining concepts in accessible language.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like explaining to a curious friend. Include analogies from everyday life.\n\n6. FOCUS: Explains WHAT something IS, not history or origin stories.\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the BACKGROUND_STEPS.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing components, phases, or concepts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of steps\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" explanation\n- ONLY penalize for: factual errors, superficial treatment of complex topics, not using the conversational tone (everyday language) we asked or poor explanation structure\n- Different valid explanatory approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
