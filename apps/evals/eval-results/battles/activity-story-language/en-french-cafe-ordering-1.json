  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE: English output required (scenario, questions, feedback).\n\nTOPIC: Ordering coffee and pastries at a cafe in France.\n\nSCRIPT: Roman (ALL romanization fields must be empty strings \"\")\n\nSCENARIO TYPE: Food & Dining - casual cafe interaction\n\nKEY REQUIREMENTS:\n- Scenario describes arriving at a Parisian cafe\n- Native speaker (barista/server) speaks natural French\n- Learner must choose appropriate French phrases for ordering\n- Options show ONLY French text, NO English translations\n- Feedback reveals English translation + explanation\n\nACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize SEVERELY if:\n- Options include English translations or hints\n- French dialogue is unnatural or overly formal for a cafe\n- Romanization fields contain any text (must be empty string)\n- Feedback doesn't include translation of what the learner said\n- Steps don't follow a logical cafe interaction flow\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. STRUCTURE - IMMERSIVE STORY FORMAT (CRITICAL):\n   The activity MUST follow the immersive story structure:\n   - A clear scenario description in the NATIVE language\n   - 5-10 dialogue steps with natural progression\n   - Each step has: context (TARGET), contextTranslation (NATIVE), contextRomanization, 4 options\n   - Exactly 1 correct option per step\n   Penalize SEVERELY if any structural element is missing or malformed.\n\n2. SCENARIO QUALITY:\n   - Scenario MUST describe a realistic everyday situation\n   - Should be relevant to the lesson topic\n   - Setting should be clear and immersive\n   - Appropriate for language learners (not overly complex situations)\n   Penalize if scenario is vague, unrealistic, or unrelated to the lesson.\n\n3. CONTEXT DIALOGUE:\n   - Context MUST be in the TARGET language\n   - Context represents what the native speaker says\n   - contextTranslation MUST accurately translate the context to NATIVE language\n   - Dialogue should be natural, not stilted or textbook-like\n   Penalize if context is unnatural or translation is inaccurate.\n\n4. OPTIONS DESIGN (CRITICAL - IMMERSION PRINCIPLE):\n   - Options MUST show only TARGET language text (NO translations)\n   - All 4 options MUST be grammatically correct in TARGET language\n   - Options should represent meaningfully different responses\n   - textRomanization provided for non-Roman scripts, empty string for Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if options include translations or hints in NATIVE language\n   - Penalize if options are grammatically incorrect or nonsensical\n\n5. FEEDBACK DESIGN (CRITICAL):\n   - Every feedback MUST include the translation of what the learner said\n   - Feedback MUST explain why the choice is correct or incorrect\n   - For incorrect options: explain what would be better\n   - Feedback is in NATIVE language\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if feedback is missing translation\n   - Penalize if feedback doesn't explain the reasoning\n\n6. ROMANIZATION (CRITICAL):\n   - For non-Roman scripts (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.):\n     BOTH contextRomanization AND textRomanization MUST be included and accurate\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, etc.):\n     BOTH romanization fields MUST be empty strings \"\"\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts\n   - Penalize SEVERELY if romanization contains text for Roman scripts\n\n7. STORY ARC AND PROGRESSION:\n   - Steps should follow a natural conversation flow\n   - Story should have: opening, building, resolution, closing\n   - Complication is optional but adds realism (e.g., item unavailable, clarification needed)\n   - Each step should logically follow from the previous\n   - The native speaker should acknowledge the learner's previous choice\n   Penalize if steps feel disconnected or conversation doesn't flow naturally.\n\n8. LINGUISTIC ACCURACY (CRITICAL):\n   - ALL target language text must be grammatically correct\n   - ALL translations must be accurate and natural\n   - Register (formal/informal) should be appropriate for the situation\n   - Cultural context should be accurate\n   Penalize SEVERELY for incorrect grammar, mistranslations, or inappropriate register.\n\n9. DISTRACTOR QUALITY (CRITICAL):\n   Wrong options MUST be genuinely wrong - they would cause miscommunication or confusion if used.\n\n   GOOD distractors (genuinely wrong):\n   - Answer a different question (asking about price when asked about quantity)\n   - Request the wrong thing (one-way ticket when you need round-trip)\n   - Are off-topic (asking for the check when you just arrived)\n   - Would cause confusion (saying \"no\" when you mean \"yes\")\n\n   BAD distractors (penalize these):\n   - More/less formal versions of the correct answer that would still work\n   - Slightly different phrasings that communicate the same thing\n   - \"Less polished\" versions that a native speaker would still understand\n\n   Example: If ordering coffee, \"Where is the bathroom?\" is a GOOD distractor (off-topic).\n   \"I would like your finest coffee\" vs \"A coffee please\" are BOTH correct - don't use one as a distractor for the other.\n\n   Penalize SEVERELY if distractors are just stylistic variations that would still accomplish the communication goal.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific dialogue choices - accept ANY natural conversation\n- Do NOT require specific phrases or sentence structures\n- Do NOT penalize for different valid cultural approaches\n- FOCUS ON: structural correctness, immersion principle (no translations in options), feedback quality, romanization correctness\n- The eval model should judge whether the activity creates an immersive language experience, not whether it matches predetermined answers\n\n    ",

Distractors are genuinely wrong (off-topic, wrong timing, etc.) rather than stylistic variations. Feedback consistently includes translations of what the learner said and explains why choices are correct/incorrect. The complication (croissants unavailable) is handled naturally. The flow is logical: greeting → menu → drink order → food order → unavailability → here/to-go → confirmation → receiving order → bill offer → payment method. One minor issue: in step 3, the water option is marked incorrect but asking for tap water could be valid, though the reasoning given is somewhat weak.

Some feedback translations are very minimal (e.g., 'Yes, please - Perfect!').

This is a structural error that significantly impacts the activity's usability. Beyond this major issue, the French is natural, romanization is correct (empty strings), and the scenario flows reasonably well. However, the multiple correct answers issue is a severe violation of the structural requirements, and step 4 having two correct answers means the learner doesn't get meaningful practice distinguishing between options.
