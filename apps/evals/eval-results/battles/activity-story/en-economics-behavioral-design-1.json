  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Behavioral economics concepts must reflect genuine research. Penalize if:\n   - Loss aversion magnitude is misrepresented (losses hurt roughly 2x gains)\n   - Framing effects are confused with actual preference changes\n   - Nudge principles are applied without understanding choice architecture\n\n2. SCENARIO CHECK: The workplace problem should involve realistic behavioral design challenges like: improving user engagement, designing incentive structures, reducing churn, or encouraging healthy behaviors.\n\n3. CONCEPTUAL FOCUS: Decisions should require reasoning about psychological biases and how to design for real human behavior.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. STORY AUTHENTICITY: Dialogue must be pure conversation between colleagues with no narrator text, no character name prefixes (like \"Sarah:\"), and no action descriptions. The learner should feel immersed in a real workplace conversation.\n\n2. EDUCATIONAL ALIGNMENT: Every decision point must require applying lesson concepts through reasoning, not memorizing facts. Wrong options should be plausible but flawed for specific conceptual reasons.\n\n3. PLOT COHERENCE: Scenes must flow naturally as a continuous story where each scene builds from the previous dialogue. The second-to-last scene MUST introduce a genuine plot twist (surprise, complication, or revelation). The final scene must resolve the problem AND reinforce the main learning takeaway.\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Verify these constraints:\n   - context: Maximum 500 characters of pure dialogue\n   - question: Maximum 100 characters\n   - options: Exactly 4 objects, each with: text (max 50 chars), isCorrect (boolean), feedback (max 300 chars)\n   - Exactly 1 option must have isCorrect: true, the other 3 must have isCorrect: false\n\n5. PERSONALIZATION: The {{NAME}} placeholder must be used appropriately in dialogue to personalize the experience.\n\n6. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Each option must have feedback explaining WHY it's right (with insight) or WHY it's wrong (and what would be correct). Feedback should help learners understand the reasoning, not just state correctness.\n\n7. SCENE COUNT: Story must have between 7 and 20 scenes. Let problem complexity dictate length.\n\n8. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: All wrong options must be plausible choices someone might consider. Penalize obviously silly or absurd options that no reasonable person would choose.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific plot choices, character names, or scenario settings you might expect\n- Do NOT require specific scenes like \"investigation\" or \"resolution\" by name - focus on whether the story has good flow\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"ideal\" story structure\n- ONLY penalize for: format violations, narrator/description text in dialogue, decisions that test memorization instead of reasoning, missing plot twist, poor distractor quality, or factually incorrect lesson application\n- Different valid story approaches exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

It has 16 scenes with excellent plot flow, building from retirement enrollment through defaults, framing, commitment devices, and culminating in a genuine plot twist (employees with dependents having lower enrollment due to real financial constraints, not behavioral issues). The dialogue is pure conversation with no narrator text or character prefixes. Every decision tests conceptual reasoning about behavioral economics principles (present bias, default effects, loss aversion, commitment devices) rather than memorization. The distractor options are all plausible and grounded in behavioral concepts. Feedback explains WHY answers are right or wrong with genuine insight. The scenario authentically addresses real-world tensions like legal pushback on defaults, ethical considerations of behavioral design, and the limits of nudges when facing genuine constraints. Loss aversion is correctly characterized (losses hurt about 2x gains). The final scene genuinely reinforces the key takeaway that behavioral design works when you understand actual constraints.",
