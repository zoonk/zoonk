Think like a language curriculum designer reviewing a colleague's work — use expertise in second language acquisition and professional judgment, not mechanical rule-checking.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Output is organized into LESSON UNITS (thematic groups) containing CONCEPTS (individual teachable items).\n  - Each concept should be a single teachable unit appropriate to the chapter's level and topic\n  - Lesson sizes should be 3-8 concepts and should vary naturally across lessons\n  - Total concept coverage should be exhaustive for the chapter's scope\n\n  ## Evaluating concept quality\n\n  Ask: \"Is this ONE teachable thing, or is it secretly a bundle of separate things?\"\n  - A concept is too broad only if it genuinely bundles multiple DISTINCT items that a student would need separate practice for\n  - Use domain expertise: conventions that look like rule violations to a generalist may be standard practice in language teaching. Grammar notation, comparison pairs, and target-language labels are all normal in language curricula\n  - Comparisons and contrasts are natural in language learning — a synonym pair or a form distinction IS a single concept when the contrast itself is what the learner needs to master\n  - Watch for false granularity: the same form repeated across different subjects or contexts is NOT multiple concepts\n  - Watch for factual accuracy: grammar rules, conjugation forms, and usage patterns must be linguistically correct for the target language\n  - Every concept must be anchored in specific target-language items the learner will produce or recognize. Abstract category labels are acceptable as lesson titles but not as individual concepts\n\n  ## Evaluating scope\n\n  The chapter description is the SOURCE OF TRUTH.\n  - Concepts must serve language acquisition — no culture, career, exam prep, or literature content\n  - The curriculum should stay at the chapter's level — an advanced chapter should not include basic content that belongs in earlier chapters\n  - In a language course, content naturally mixes the user's language and the target language — this is expected, not a language violation\n\n  ## Evaluating lesson quality\n\n  - Lesson descriptions should be concise — no filler words like \"introduces\", \"presents\", \"teaches\"\n  - Logical progression from foundational to advanced\n  - No summary, review, or assessment lessons\n  - No duplicate concepts across lessons\n\n  ## Coverage\n\n  Completeness is the key metric. Are all topics in the chapter description covered with sufficient granularity?\n\n  ## How to score\n\n  Start by asking: \"Would this curriculum actually teach the chapter effectively?\" Then look for issues.\n\n  A curriculum that would genuinely teach the chapter well but has some title-phrasing imperfections deserves a high score. A curriculum that looks structurally clean but wouldn't actually help a learner (e.g., abstract categories instead of practicable items, factual errors in grammar) deserves a low score.\n\n  When something looks like a rule violation but makes pedagogical sense in context, favor the pedagogical judgment. The rules exist to produce good curricula — if the curriculum is good despite a technical rule bend, that matters more than the rule.\n\n    ",

It has 9 lessons covering: そうだ (様態) basic formation, そうだ (様態) inflection/positions, そうだ (様態) negation, そうだ (伝聞) formation, そうだ (伝聞) past/negation/colloquial, らしい inference, らしい typicality, みたい formation, and register differences. The granularity is excellent — it separates negation forms, past forms, and colloquial variants into distinct concepts. It correctly includes irregularities like いい→よさそうだ and even notes the かわいそう lexicalized form (a real teaching point). The lessons stay within 3-8 concepts. It includes そうだって (colloquial hearsay) and らしく/らしさ derivations which are genuinely useful. The lesson descriptions follow the rules (no 'introduces' etc.). Some minor issues: 名詞＋そうだ（様態）is questionable — そうだ (appearance) doesn't typically attach directly to nouns in standard grammar. Also one concept has a typo '推est' instead of '推定'. But overall this is the most complete and pedagogically sound curriculum. It doesn't include ようだ which is arguably implied by the chapter description through みたい's formal counterpart, but the chapter description doesn't explicitly list it.",

The inclusion of ようだ is justified since the chapter mentions register differences. The complementary expressions lesson (どうやら〜らしい, 〜そうな顔, 〜って聞いた, 〜っぽい) adds useful practical items though some might be considered outside strict chapter scope. However, there are some issues: some concepts read more like descriptions than glossary entries (e.g., 'Significado de ～そうだ (aparência): parece que vai / parece ser' is explanatory rather than a practicable item). Having separate concepts for 'structural difference' and 'meaning difference' in the contrast lesson creates some redundancy. The lesson 'Comparação Geral: Registro e Nuance' has concepts like 'Escolha da expressão por contexto: fala, escrita, notícia' which is quite abstract. Still, coverage is excellent and the progression is logical.",

The register lesson has some concepts that are slightly too descriptive/abstract (e.g., 'Registro: 〜そうだ（見た目） é comum em fala e escrita neutra' reads like a description rather than a practicable item). The final concept 'Padrão de escolha' is essentially a summary/decision tree which borders on meta-skill territory. Missing: いい→よさそうだ and ない→なさそうだ irregularities in the appearance lesson.

Strengths: good use of Japanese examples in parentheses, includes ようだ coverage. Weaknesses: missing いい→よさそうだ irregularity; the らしい lesson has only 4 concepts which is thin — it's missing negative and past verb forms with らしい; the register comparison concepts in lesson 5 are somewhat abstract ('Registro: らしい（聞き伝え・性質の示唆） vs そうだ（視覚的外見 vs 聞き伝えの区別）' bundles multiple contrasts).

Weaknesses: missing らしい as typicality (noun+らしい meaning 'typical of'); the contrast concepts are good but some are bundled oddly; the final lesson on politeness registers is a bit abstract with concepts like 'Linguagem Falada: Omissão de だ em 〜みたい'; missing ようだ coverage (which is relevant given the chapter mentions register differences and みたい/ようだ is a key register pair); concept titles are in Portuguese which is appropriate but some could be more concise.

The concept 'Advérbio de Comparação: まるで' is a useful addition but doesn't compensate for missing core grammar. Some concepts bundle too much (e.g., 'Verbo/Adjetivo + みたい (Inferência)' covers multiple word classes in one concept).
