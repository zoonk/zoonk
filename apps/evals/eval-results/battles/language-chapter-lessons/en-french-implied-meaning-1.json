The progression is logical: it moves from foundational concepts (explicit vs. implicit meaning) through implicature types, presupposition triggers (broken down by individual words/constructions), discourse markers, hedges, mitigators, politeness strategies, euphemisms (broken into individual topic areas), and scalar implicatures. Titles are concise and specific, avoiding 'AND'/'OR'/'VS' in almost all cases. Descriptions are focused and avoid fluff words like 'learn' or 'explore'. The coverage is comprehensive across all chapter requirements: implicature, presuppositions, euphemism, and pragmatic inference are all thoroughly covered as distinct concepts. The lessons stay within pure language acquisition. Minor issues: a few lessons could potentially be slightly too theoretical (e.g., 'Asserted content', 'Presupposed content') but they are still explainable in tweets. Overall, this is the most thorough and well-executed response.",

The lessons build logically from basic to advanced. Titles are mostly concise and specific. However, some title conventions are slightly inconsistent (using arrows like ⇒ in titles), and a few lessons border on overlapping (e.g., 'Encore: Presupposed Earlier Event' and 'Encore: Presupposed Non-Change' are two separate senses well-handled, but 'Même: Implied Unexpectedness' appears both in scalar implicature section and presupposition section). Some lessons touch on career-adjacent euphemisms ('Euphemism: Être en difficulté') but frame it as pure vocabulary. A few titles use colons with long explanatory phrases.

The progression is logical. However, some lessons violate the prompt rules: 'Bon' and 'Bref' as Implied Topic Closers' uses 'and' in the title and should be split. 'Reading Between the Lines in Dialogues' sounds like a practice/review lesson rather than a single-concept lesson. Some titles are a bit long or use question formats ('What Is Implied Meaning in French?', 'What Are Presuppositions?', 'What Are Euphemisms in French?'). The description for the first lesson uses 'why implied meaning matters' which is slightly fluffy. Some euphemism lessons bundle multiple expressions.

However, the list is not extensive enough for the chapter's scope - it misses many important areas: rhetorical questions, irony, indirect refusals, discourse markers (quand même, enfin, bref, donc), tu/vous implications, vague language, silence as meaning, many euphemism categories (only death and toileting covered).

However, several issues: multiple titles use 'AND' or 'OR' which the prompt explicitly forbids ('Death and Illness', 'Body and Intimacy', 'Criticism and Failure', 'Tu vs. Vous'). Some lessons are too broad (e.g., 'Presuppositions Triggered by Verbs' covers arrêter, continuer, cesser in one lesson; 'Scalar Implicature: Quantity Words' covers quelques, plusieurs, tous, certains together). The euphemism lessons bundle multiple topics ('Death and Illness' should be split). 'Producing Implied Meaning Naturally' sounds like a summary/practice lesson. 'Context and Pragmatic Inference' is very broad. 'Recognizing Irony in Written French' borders on a skill lesson rather than single concept.

However, the list is not extensive enough - it's the smallest set and misses many important chapter topics: Gricean maxims are entirely absent, there's no coverage of scalar implicature theory, no discourse markers (quand même, en fait, bref, donc, enfin), no presupposition projection tests, no hedging expressions, minimal coverage of presupposition triggers (missing definite articles, cleft sentences, temporal clauses), no indirect requests beyond two examples, limited euphemism coverage. The chapter description calls for 'implication, euphemism, and pragmatic inference' comprehensively, and this list only scratches the surface of each.

Some lessons are too broad ('Implied Meaning: Conditional Mood' covers both politeness and hypothetical conditions). The lesson on 'Euphemisms: Professional Status' touches on career language which the prompt forbids. The list lacks logical progression structure and feels incomplete. While the individual lessons that exist are reasonably focused, the overall coverage is far too thin for a chapter on implied meaning, presuppositions, and pragmatic inference.
