It covers ser and estar conjugations, identity, origin, location, sentence patterns, questions, negation, adjective agreement, prepositions, and even useful vocabulary like también/tampoco and muy/un poco. It breaks down ser vs estar meaning shifts into individual adjective lessons (listo, rico, verde, bueno, malo, abierto), which is impressively granular. However, it has several title violations: 'Ser vs Estar: Quick Choice Rule', 'Ser vs Estar: Identity vs State', 'Ser vs Estar: Adjective Meaning Shift', 'Ser vs Estar: Listo', 'Ser vs Estar: Rico', 'Ser vs Estar: Verde', 'Ser vs Estar: Bueno', 'Ser vs Estar: Malo', 'Ser vs Estar: Abierto' — many of these use 'vs' in the title which the prompt explicitly says should be split. However, for contrast lessons specifically comparing the two verbs, some 'vs' usage might be acceptable since the concept IS the contrast. 'Aquí Ahí Allí' has implicit 'and' combining three concepts. 'Ser: Day and Date' uses 'and'. The descriptions are well-written and concise. Coverage of chapter topics (identity, origin, location, sentence patterns) is thorough. The mini-dialogues at the end provide practical application. Some lessons like 'Ser: Event Location' and telling time might stretch slightly beyond the chapter scope but are reasonable. Overall very strong.",

It covers ser and estar conjugations, uses of each verb, sentence patterns, questions, negation, adjective meaning changes, pronunciation, and mini-dialogues. The granularity is generally good but some lessons are too broad: 'Adjectives That Change Meaning with Ser or Estar' covers multiple adjectives in one lesson (listo, aburrido, rico), 'Ser: Time and Dates' combines two concepts with 'and', 'Ser + De: Origin, Possession, Material' combines three concepts with commas, 'Mini-Dialogues: Ser and Estar Together' combines both verbs. Several titles violate the 'vs' rule: 'Ser vs. Estar: Describing People', 'Common Mistakes: Ser vs. Estar', 'Choosing Ser or Estar: A Quick Guide'. 'Common Mistakes' is essentially a review/summary lesson which is forbidden. 'Choosing Ser or Estar: A Quick Guide' sounds like a summary. The lesson 'Estar: Bien and Mal' uses 'and'. 'Question Words with Ser' and 'Question Words with Estar' each combine multiple question words. Descriptions use forbidden words like 'tips' and the description style is generally good but some are too broad. Coverage is adequate but not as extensive as some other models.",

It breaks down conjugations per person for both ser and estar (6 each = 12 conjugation lessons), which is very granular but arguably too granular for conjugation — each person's conjugation is a single form that doesn't fill 2-3 minutes. Coverage of uses: identity with names, professions, nationalities, origin with de, origin with cities, origin with countries. Location is covered with en, people, objects, and places. Sentence patterns cover affirmative, negative, and interrogative for both verbs, plus subject omission. The choosing ser/estar section covers identity, origin, and location. However, there are notable gaps: no adjective agreement lessons, no adjective meaning shift lessons, no question word lessons (quién, qué, dónde, cómo), no vocabulary for common adjectives, no pronunciation lessons, and limited practical dialogue/conversational patterns. 'Ser: Origin with Cities' and 'Ser: Origin with Countries' seem artificially split — both use 'ser de + place'. Title style is clean with no 'and/or/vs' violations. Descriptions are concise but sometimes too sparse. The model follows rules well but coverage is incomplete for a chapter that includes 'basic sentence patterns' and 'describing identity, origin, and location.'",

However, it is arguably over-granular in some areas: separate lessons for 'en el', 'en la', 'en los', 'en las' are excessively split — these are the same concept (using en + definite article). Similarly, splitting 'Estoy en + Place', 'Está en + Place', 'Estamos en + Place', 'Están en + Place' into four separate lessons is excessive. Having both '¿Eres…?' and '¿Es…?' as separate identity question lessons is redundant. 'Pronunciation: oy in soy' and 'Pronunciation: oy in estoy' — these cover the same sound. Location phrases like 'encima de', 'debajo de', 'al lado de', 'cerca de', 'lejos de' may go beyond the chapter scope of 'basic sentence patterns and describing identity, origin, and location.' The contraction lessons (del, al) are useful but 'al' may be beyond scope. Some titles have issues: the em-dash in 'Ser–Estar Choice' titles is fine but could be seen as combining concepts. No 'and/or/vs' violations noted. The indefinite article lessons (un/una) are tangential. Despite over-splitting in some areas, coverage is comprehensive.

However, several lessons are too broad: 'Ser: Identity (name and profession)' combines two concepts, 'Adjective agreement: Gender and number' combines two concepts with 'and', 'Questions with Ser' and 'Questions with Estar' each combine yes/no and information questions, 'Omitting Subject Pronouns with Ser/Estar' uses a slash combining both verbs. It includes vosotros forms which contradicts the Latin American Spanish focus implied by US English. Missing: common adjective vocabulary, prepositions for location, meaning shifts with same adjectives, practical phrases like '¿Cómo estás?', adverbs of location, contractions, and more.

'Adjectives That Change Meaning: Ser' and 'Adjectives That Change Meaning: Estar' are still somewhat broad. 'Exceptions to the Permanent/Temporary Rule' feels like an advanced meta-lesson. 'Ser: Adjective Agreement with Nationality' overlaps with 'Ser: Nationalities'. The permanent/temporary framing is an oversimplification that many linguists would consider misleading — estar is used for death ('está muerto') which is permanent.
