It covers: formation (have/has), regular and irregular participles (split into multiple groups), negatives, questions, contractions, ever/never with position and usage as separate lessons, just/already/yet each with meaning, position, and example sentences as separate lessons, differences between already/yet and just/already, results with present perfect, 'been to' vs 'gone to', 'How many times', ever with superlatives, common errors, pronunciation (3 lessons), and dialogues. The titles are specific and concise. Descriptions are clear and focused. However, there are a few issues: (1) 'Have vs. Has: según el sujeto' uses 'vs' in the title which violates the rules; (2) 'Been to vs. Gone to' also uses 'vs'; (3) The dialogue lessons at the end could be seen as slightly broad but are acceptable. (4) Some lessons like 'Oraciones comunes con just/already/yet' feel like they could overlap with the meaning lessons. (5) 'ever con superlativos' and 'How many times' slightly stretch the chapter scope but are reasonable extensions. Despite the 'vs' violations, the overall coverage is the most comprehensive and well-structured.",

It has exceptional granularity, breaking down concepts very finely: have/has separately, contractions separately, pronunciation of contractions, participle function, regular participles with three pronunciation variants (/t/, /d/, /ɪd/), questions split by person, negatives split by have/has, contractions split, ever/never each with meaning+position+template+double negation, been/gone separately, just/already/yet each with meaning+position+template, already with position variants (middle and final), already in questions, yet in questions and negatives separately, and useful 'avoid' lessons at the end. Titles are specific and focused. No 'AND/OR/VS' violations. The progression is logical. Coverage is thorough. Some minor issues: (1) 'Adverbio: posición media' is a bit premature and abstract before introducing the specific adverbs; (2) Some lessons might be overly granular (e.g., separate lessons for 'have not' and 'has not' AND separate lessons for 'haven't' and 'hasn't' - that's 4 lessons for negation which could feel repetitive); (3) The pronunciation lessons for -ed sounds are great additions within scope. Overall excellent coverage with strong adherence to the single-concept rule.",

It properly splits have/has into separate lessons, covers regular and irregular participles (2 groups), splits affirmatives by have/has, splits contractions and negations separately, covers ever/never/just/already/yet each with meaning and position as separate lessons, and splits yet into questions and negatives. Strengths: no 'AND/OR/VS' violations, clean single-concept focus, logical progression. Weaknesses: (1) Only 2 groups for irregular participles - could be more extensive; (2) Missing some important topics like 'been to' vs 'gone to', pronunciation, common errors, ever with superlatives, 'Have you ever been to...?' pattern, and results with present perfect beyond the basic explanation; (3) No example/pattern lessons; (4) Less extensive coverage compared to Models A, E, and F.

These are significant violations of the prompt's explicit rules about AND/OR/VS and single-concept focus. The irregular participles get only one lesson ('common irregular verbs') which is too broad.

Strengths: covers formation, contractions, regular/irregular participles, ever/never/just/already/yet with position and meaning, been/gone distinction, pronunciation, common errors, experiences with frequency. The error lessons at the end are practical. However: (1) Lesson 24 title 'Just: matiz de inmediatez' has description comparing just and already - this is a comparison lesson disguised as a single concept; (2) Lesson 25 'Yet: expectativa pendiente' similarly compares yet and already; (3) Lesson 30 'Elección: already' is vague and the description mentions 'yet'; (4) Lesson 31 'Yet: todavía en negativas' seems redundant with lesson 16; (5) Some lessons seem to have overlapping content; (6) Irregular participles get only one lesson which is too broad; (7) Contractions are in one lesson combining affirmative and negative forms.
