  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\nThis test covers market share - an economics/business concept with numerical data.\n\nACCURACY CHECKS - PENALIZE if:\n- Chart data is unrealistic (e.g., market share values that don't make sense)\n- Economic concepts are incorrectly explained\n- Pie chart values don't sum to 100% (if pie chart is used)\n\nREDUNDANCY CHECKS - PENALIZE if:\n- Multiple charts show the same data\n- The same market share examples are repeated across visuals\n\nVISUAL-CONTENT FIT - PENALIZE if:\n- Code visual is used (no programming content)\n- Timeline is used for content that isn't about historical market evolution\n\nDo NOT PENALIZE if:\n- Image visuals are used\n- No chart is used (market share can be explained without charts)\n- Diagram showing market relationships is used\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. COVERAGE: Every step must have exactly one visual. Check that the number of visuals equals the number of steps and stepIndex values are unique and complete (0 to N-1).\n\n2. NO REDUNDANCY: Each visual must add UNIQUE information. PENALIZE if:\n   - Multiple visuals repeat the same data points, events, or concepts\n   - A visual restates what another visual already showed\n   - Example: Two timelines covering overlapping periods with the same events\n\n3. VISUAL-CONTENT FIT: The visual type must make sense for the content. PENALIZE if:\n   - Code visual is used for non-programming content\n   - Chart is used without numerical/statistical data to display\n   - Timeline is used for content with no temporal/sequential element\n   - Quote is fabricated or misattributed (must be real, verifiable quotes)\n\n   Do NOT penalize if:\n   - Image is used for any content (image can visualize anything)\n   - Diagram is used instead of timeline (relationships can be shown multiple ways)\n   - Any visual type is used multiple times (if each instance adds unique value)\n\n4. TECHNICAL ACCURACY: Visual content must be factually correct:\n   - Code must be syntactically valid\n   - Historical dates and events must be accurate\n   - Scientific processes must be correctly represented\n   - Chart data must be realistic and internally consistent\n\n5. LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY: All text in visuals must match the specified language. PENALIZE any mixed-language content.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT expect specific visual types based on topic (history does not require timeline; programming does not require code)\n- Do NOT penalize for using \"image\" as the visual type - it is a valid choice for any content\n- Do NOT penalize for using the same visual type multiple times IF each adds unique information\n- Do NOT require variety in visual types - consistency is fine if appropriate\n- ONLY penalize for: redundant information across visuals, visual type that cannot represent the content, technical inaccuracies, language errors, missing steps\n\n    ",
