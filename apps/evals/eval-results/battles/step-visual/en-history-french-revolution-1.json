  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\nThis test covers historical content about the French Revolution (1789-1799).\n\nACCURACY CHECKS - PENALIZE if:\n- Any historical dates are wrong (key dates: 1789 Bastille, 1791 Constitution, 1793 Reign of Terror, 1799 Napoleon's coup)\n- Historical quotes are fabricated or misattributed\n- Cause-effect relationships are historically inaccurate\n\nREDUNDANCY CHECKS - PENALIZE if:\n- Multiple visuals cover the same historical events\n- The same dates/figures appear across different visuals without adding new information\n\nVISUAL-CONTENT FIT - PENALIZE if:\n- Code visual is used (no programming content)\n- Chart visual is used without meaningful numerical data\n\nDo NOT PENALIZE if:\n- All steps use image visuals (valid if each shows distinct content)\n- No timeline is used (historical content can be visualized many ways)\n- A diagram showing cause-effect is used instead of a timeline\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. COVERAGE: Every step must have exactly one visual. Check that the number of visuals equals the number of steps and stepIndex values are unique and complete (0 to N-1).\n\n2. NO REDUNDANCY: Each visual must add UNIQUE information. PENALIZE if:\n   - Multiple visuals repeat the same data points, events, or concepts\n   - A visual restates what another visual already showed\n   - Example: Two timelines covering overlapping periods with the same events\n\n3. VISUAL-CONTENT FIT: The visual type must make sense for the content. PENALIZE if:\n   - Code visual is used for non-programming content\n   - Chart is used without numerical/statistical data to display\n   - Timeline is used for content with no temporal/sequential element\n   - Quote is fabricated or misattributed (must be real, verifiable quotes)\n\n   Do NOT penalize if:\n   - Image is used for any content (image can visualize anything)\n   - Diagram is used instead of timeline (relationships can be shown multiple ways)\n   - Any visual type is used multiple times (if each instance adds unique value)\n\n4. TECHNICAL ACCURACY: Visual content must be factually correct:\n   - Code must be syntactically valid\n   - Historical dates and events must be accurate\n   - Scientific processes must be correctly represented\n   - Chart data must be realistic and internally consistent\n\n5. LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY: All text in visuals must match the specified language. PENALIZE any mixed-language content.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT expect specific visual types based on topic (history does not require timeline; programming does not require code)\n- Do NOT penalize for using \"image\" as the visual type - it is a valid choice for any content\n- Do NOT penalize for using the same visual type multiple times IF each adds unique information\n- Do NOT require variety in visual types - consistency is fine if appropriate\n- ONLY penalize for: redundant information across visuals, visual type that cannot represent the content, technical inaccuracies, language errors, missing steps\n\n    ",
