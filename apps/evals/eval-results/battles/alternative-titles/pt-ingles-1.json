  "expectations": "\n      - Should include \"Língua Inglesa\", \"A Língua Inglesa\"\n      - Variants like \"Inglês Americano\", \"Inglês Britânico\" are acceptable since they refer to the same language\n      - Terms like \"Inglês Moderno\" and \"Inglês Contemporâneo\" are acceptable since they refer to the same language\n      - Should include any title that a user might search for when wanting to learn English, since our platform consolidates all English learning into one course\n      - This INCLUDES: \"Gramática Inglesa\", \"Vocabulário de Inglês\", \"Pronúncia do Inglês\", \"Conversação em Inglês\", \"TOEFL\", \"IELTS\", \"Cambridge English\" — these all map to the same English course\n      - Professional/purpose context is also acceptable: \"Inglês Técnico\", \"Inglês para Negócios\", \"Business English\", \"Inglês para Entrevistas\", \"Inglês Acadêmico\" — these are all English learning, not separate subjects\n      - Well-known English terms are acceptable even in Portuguese titles (e.g., \"Business English\", \"TOEFL\", \"IELTS\")\n      - Should NOT include: \"Cultura Inglesa\" (culture, not language learning), \"Literatura Inglesa\" (literature, not language learning), \"Spanish\" (different language)\n      - Should be in Portuguese\n\n      \n  **PURPOSE**: Alternative titles prevent AI from generating duplicate courses for the same subject. If someone creates \"Python for Data Science\", the AI should recognize it as the existing \"Python\" course — not create a separate one. The list catches all title variants that map to the same course.\n\n  **CORE RULE**: If the title still contains the base subject (or a recognized synonym/abbreviation), it is the SAME course — regardless of qualifiers, subtitles, tools, focus areas, or context added to it. We do NOT want separate courses for each variant.\n\n  Examples of this rule:\n  - \"World War II: Normandy and D-Day\" → contains \"World War II\" → same course\n  - \"Python for Data Science\" → contains \"Python\" → same course\n  - \"IA Generativa\" → contains \"IA\" → same course\n  - \"Desarrollo Web con React\" → contains \"Desarrollo Web\" → same course\n  - \"ML with Python\" → contains \"ML\" → same course\n  - \"Differential Calculus\" → contains \"Calculus\" → same course\n  - \"Formula 1 Motorsport\" → contains \"Formula 1\" → same course\n\n  **When to EXCLUDE**:\n  - **Broader**: The title covers a larger domain that encompasses unrelated subjects → exclude. Example: \"Web Development\" is broader than \"Frontend Development\"; \"Programming\" is broader than \"Python\"; standalone \"Motorsport\" is broader than \"Formula 1\".\n  - **Standalone different subject**: The title drops the base subject entirely and represents something else → exclude. Example: \"React\" (no \"JavaScript\" in the title — it’s its own technology); \"Deep Learning\" (no \"Machine Learning\" — it’s its own field); \"Battle of Normandy\" (no \"World War II\" — it’s its own topic); standalone \"Motorsport\" (no \"Formula 1\").\n  - **Ambiguous**: The title could refer to multiple unrelated topics → exclude. Example: just \"Matrix\" without any disambiguator.\n\n  **Also include** (even without the base subject in the title):\n  - **Recognized synonyms/abbreviations**: \"WWII\" / \"Second World War\" ↔ \"World War II\"; \"F1\" ↔ \"Formula 1\"; \"ML\" ↔ \"Machine Learning\"; \"JS\" ↔ \"JavaScript\"; \"UI Development\" / \"Client-Side Development\" ↔ \"Frontend Development\".\n  - **Dialect/variant names**: \"Inglês Americano\", \"Inglês Britânico\", \"Optimisation\" vs \"Optimization\".\n  - **Language learning aspects**: \"Gramática Inglesa\", \"TOEFL\", \"Business English\" — all map to the same language course.\n  - **Light framing words**: \"principles\", \"fundamentals\", \"basics\", \"bootcamp\", \"certification prep\" — these don’t change the subject.\n  - **Descriptive disambiguators**: \"The Matrix (1999 film)\", \"Matrix Movie\" — these clarify which subject, they don’t change it.\n\n  Additional notes:\n  - Include different locale spellings when applicable (e.g., \"Optimization\" and \"Optimisation\").\n  - Include abbreviations if they mean the same thing (e.g., \"AI\"/\"IA\", \"ML\" when base is \"Machine Learning\").\n  - Levels like \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\", \"Calculus 1\", \"101\", etc., are acceptable.\n  - It’s fine to skip spacing/hyphenation/accents variants — serialization will handle those.\n  - Awkward or redundant phrasings are acceptable.\n  - Ignore casing issues (e.g., \"javascript\" vs \"JavaScript\").\n  - Well-known English terms in non-English titles are acceptable (e.g., \"Business English\" in Portuguese, \"TOEFL\", \"IELTS\").\n  - Ideally, it should have a huge list of alternative titles, really good ones have more than 100 alternative titles\n\n  SCORING CALIBRATION:\n  - Apply the CORE RULE above as the PRIMARY lens: does the title still contain the base subject? If yes → it’s the same course, do NOT penalize.\n  - Only penalize for titles that are genuinely broader (umbrella domain), a standalone different subject (base subject dropped entirely), or ambiguous.\n  - Do NOT penalize for qualifiers, subtitles, tools, focus areas, or context added to the base subject — these are all the same course.\n  - Do NOT heavily penalize for missing titles — only penalize for wrong inclusion/exclusion decisions.\n  - A large list is ideal but do NOT heavily penalize shorter lists if all included titles are correct.\n\n    ",

It avoids including broader topics or genuinely different subjects. All titles are in Portuguese as required. No problematic inclusions that I can identify. The only minor issue is that standalone exam acronyms like 'TOEFL' and 'IELTS' are included as 'Inglês para TOEFL' and 'Preparatório TOEFL' rather than standalone, but those are fine. It doesn't include standalone 'TOEFL' or 'IELTS' which the task expectations say should be included. However, it has 'Preparatório TOEFL' etc. which partially covers this. Missing 'A Língua Inglesa' - actually it does include it. Missing standalone 'TOEFL', 'IELTS', 'Cambridge English' as standalone entries. This is a minor gap. Overall excellent coverage.",
