  "expectations": "\n      - Should include \"Matrix Movie\" (without \"The\")\n      - May include \"The Matrix Trilogy\" and similar variations since it refers to the same film series\n      - Should NOT include just \"Matrix\" (ambiguous)\n      - Should NOT include broader courses like \"Science Fiction Films\"\n      - Results should be in English\n\n      \n  - Only include titles that are **equivalent** to the base title — i.e., they refer to the **same course** a user would expect to find under that subject.\n  - **Same‑course test** (use all of these):\n    1) Would we merge both titles into one course page? If yes, they are equivalent.\n    2) Would teaching goals, syllabus scope, and prerequisites remain the same? If yes, they are equivalent.\n    3) Is the difference only wording, dialect/variant, audience, abbreviation, or light framing? If yes, they are equivalent.\n  - **Broader/narrower rule**:\n    - **Broader** expands scope beyond the subject’s core boundaries → exclude. Example: \"Web Development\" is broader than \"Frontend Development\".\n    - **Narrower** is a proper subset that we’d plausibly ship as a separate course (different scope/learning goals) → exclude. Example: \"React\" is narrower than \"JavaScript\"; \"Deep Learning\" is narrower than \"Machine Learning\".\n  - **Not narrower (allowed)** when it is still the same course subject:\n    - **Dialect/variant** names (e.g., \"Inglês Americano\", \"Inglês Britânico\", \"French Grammar\", \"Optimisation\" vs \"Optimization\"). Dialects are surface variants of the same language course.\n    - **Audience qualifiers** (e.g., \"IA para Desenvolvedores\", \"UX for Healthcare\"). Audience framing ≠ topic narrowing if the core subject stays the same.\n    - **Series/labeling of the same entity** (e.g., \"Formula One\", \"F1\", \"Formula One Championship\", \"F1 Series\") — these all clearly denote the same sport/competition brand.\n    - **Light framing words** like \"principles\", \"fundamentals\", \"basics\", \"overview\", or \"for beginners\" when the core topic remains unchanged.\n  - **Decision checklist for each candidate title** (answer all):\n    - Does it introduce a different subfield or tool? If yes → narrower → exclude.\n    - Does it expand to an umbrella domain? If yes → broader → exclude.\n    - If we offered both titles simultaneously, would users be confused by two separate courses? If yes → they are equivalent and, therefore, can be included as an alternative title.\n  - **Concrete examples**:\n    - **Include**: \"Client‑Side Web Development\" ↔ \"Frontend Development\"; \"IA\" / \"Inteligência Artificial\" / \"IA para Desenvolvedores\"; \"Inglês\" ↔ \"Inglês Americano\" / \"Inglês Britânico\" / \"Inglês Britânico e Americano\"; \"Formula 1\" ↔ \"Formula One\" / \"F1\" / \"Formula One Championship\" / \"F1 Series\"; \"UX Design\" ↔ \"UX Design Principles\"; \"World War II\" ↔ \"WWII\" / \"Second World War\"; \"Data Science\" ↔ \"Data Science Fundamentals\".\n    - **Exclude**: \"Web Development\" (broader than \"Frontend Development\"); \"Aprendizado de Máquina\" (narrower than \"Inteligência Artificial\"); \"React\" (narrower than \"JavaScript\"); \"Deep Learning\" (narrower than \"Machine Learning\"); \"Motorsport\" (broader than \"Formula 1\"); \"Differential Calculus\" (narrower than \"Calculus\").\n  - Include different locale spellings when applicable (e.g., \"Optimization\" and \"Optimisation\").\n  - Include abbreviations if they mean the same thing (e.g., \"AI\"/\"IA\", \"ML\" when base is \"Machine Learning\").\n  - Levels like \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\", \"Calculus 1\", \"101\", etc., are acceptable if they keep the same subject.\n  - It’s fine to skip spacing/hyphenation/accents variants — serialization will handle those.\n  - Awkward or redundant phrasings are acceptable.\n  - Ignore casing issues (e.g., \"javascript\" vs \"JavaScript\").\n  - Ideally, it should have a huge list of alternative titles, really good ones have more than 100 alternative titles\n\n    ",

It systematically generates variations with different framing words (Introduction to, Exploring, Understanding, Discovering, Guide to, etc.) combined with different base forms (Movie, Film, Franchise, Trilogy, etc.), creating a large list of 160+ alternatives. The titles are all plausibly equivalent courses. It avoids narrower subtopics (no philosophy-specific, soundtrack-specific, etc.).
