  "expectations": "\n      - Should include \"World War 2\", \"Second World War\", \"WWII\", \"WW2\"\n      - Subtitled variants like \"World War II: Normandy and D-Day\", \"World War II: Holocaust and Genocide\", \"European Theater of World War II\" are acceptable — they still contain \"World War II\", so they're the same course\n      - Should NOT include standalone topics that drop \"World War II\" entirely, like \"Battle of Normandy\", \"D-Day\", \"Holocaust\" — those could be their own courses\n      - Should NOT include just \"World War\" (broader) or \"World War I\" (different subject)\n      - Results should be in English\n\n      \n  **PURPOSE**: Alternative titles prevent AI from generating duplicate courses for the same subject. If someone creates \"Python for Data Science\", the AI should recognize it as the existing \"Python\" course — not create a separate one. The list catches all title variants that map to the same course.\n\n  **CORE RULE**: If the title still contains the base subject (or a recognized synonym/abbreviation), it is the SAME course — regardless of qualifiers, subtitles, tools, focus areas, or context added to it. We do NOT want separate courses for each variant.\n\n  Examples of this rule:\n  - \"World War II: Normandy and D-Day\" → contains \"World War II\" → same course\n  - \"Python for Data Science\" → contains \"Python\" → same course\n  - \"IA Generativa\" → contains \"IA\" → same course\n  - \"Desarrollo Web con React\" → contains \"Desarrollo Web\" → same course\n  - \"ML with Python\" → contains \"ML\" → same course\n  - \"Differential Calculus\" → contains \"Calculus\" → same course\n  - \"Formula 1 Motorsport\" → contains \"Formula 1\" → same course\n\n  **When to EXCLUDE**:\n  - **Broader**: The title covers a larger domain that encompasses unrelated subjects → exclude. Example: \"Web Development\" is broader than \"Frontend Development\"; \"Programming\" is broader than \"Python\"; standalone \"Motorsport\" is broader than \"Formula 1\".\n  - **Standalone different subject**: The title drops the base subject entirely and represents something else → exclude. Example: \"React\" (no \"JavaScript\" in the title — it’s its own technology); \"Deep Learning\" (no \"Machine Learning\" — it’s its own field); \"Battle of Normandy\" (no \"World War II\" — it’s its own topic); standalone \"Motorsport\" (no \"Formula 1\").\n  - **Ambiguous**: The title could refer to multiple unrelated topics → exclude. Example: just \"Matrix\" without any disambiguator.\n\n  **Also include** (even without the base subject in the title):\n  - **Recognized synonyms/abbreviations**: \"WWII\" / \"Second World War\" ↔ \"World War II\"; \"F1\" ↔ \"Formula 1\"; \"ML\" ↔ \"Machine Learning\"; \"JS\" ↔ \"JavaScript\"; \"UI Development\" / \"Client-Side Development\" ↔ \"Frontend Development\".\n  - **Dialect/variant names**: \"Inglês Americano\", \"Inglês Britânico\", \"Optimisation\" vs \"Optimization\".\n  - **Language learning aspects**: \"Gramática Inglesa\", \"TOEFL\", \"Business English\" — all map to the same language course.\n  - **Light framing words**: \"principles\", \"fundamentals\", \"basics\", \"bootcamp\", \"certification prep\" — these don’t change the subject.\n  - **Descriptive disambiguators**: \"The Matrix (1999 film)\", \"Matrix Movie\" — these clarify which subject, they don’t change it.\n\n  Additional notes:\n  - Include different locale spellings when applicable (e.g., \"Optimization\" and \"Optimisation\").\n  - Include abbreviations if they mean the same thing (e.g., \"AI\"/\"IA\", \"ML\" when base is \"Machine Learning\").\n  - Levels like \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\", \"Calculus 1\", \"101\", etc., are acceptable.\n  - It’s fine to skip spacing/hyphenation/accents variants — serialization will handle those.\n  - Awkward or redundant phrasings are acceptable.\n  - Ignore casing issues (e.g., \"javascript\" vs \"JavaScript\").\n  - Well-known English terms in non-English titles are acceptable (e.g., \"Business English\" in Portuguese, \"TOEFL\", \"IELTS\").\n  - Ideally, it should have a huge list of alternative titles, really good ones have more than 100 alternative titles\n\n  SCORING CALIBRATION:\n  - Apply the CORE RULE above as the PRIMARY lens: does the title still contain the base subject? If yes → it’s the same course, do NOT penalize.\n  - Only penalize for titles that are genuinely broader (umbrella domain), a standalone different subject (base subject dropped entirely), or ambiguous.\n  - Do NOT penalize for qualifiers, subtitles, tools, focus areas, or context added to the base subject — these are all the same course.\n  - Do NOT heavily penalize for missing titles — only penalize for wrong inclusion/exclusion decisions.\n  - A large list is ideal but do NOT heavily penalize shorter lists if all included titles are correct.\n\n    ",

It includes many subtitled variants that still contain the base subject (e.g., 'World War II: Normandy and D-Day', 'European Theater of World War II', 'The Holocaust in World War II'). Importantly, it correctly disambiguates battle references by keeping 'World War II' or 'WWII' in the title (e.g., 'Battle of Stalingrad (World War II)', 'Battle of Kursk (World War II)', 'Battle of Midway (World War II)'). This follows the core rule perfectly. It includes level variations, light framing words, and comprehensive coverage of sub-topics all properly qualified with the base subject. The only minor issue is 'The Great Patriotic War (World War II)' which is fine since it's disambiguated. There are a few titles that could be slightly borderline like 'WWII and the Origins of the Cold War' but it still contains WWII. Very well done overall.",
