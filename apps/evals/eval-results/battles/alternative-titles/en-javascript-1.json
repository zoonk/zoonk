  "expectations": "\n      - Should include \"JS\", \"JavaScript Programming\", \"JavaScript Language\", etc\n      - Should NOT include \"Web Development\", \"React\" since they're different courses\n      - Results should be in English\n\n      \n  **PURPOSE**: Alternative titles prevent AI from generating duplicate courses for the same subject. If someone creates \"Python for Data Science\", the AI should recognize it as the existing \"Python\" course — not create a separate one. The list catches all title variants that map to the same course.\n\n  **CORE RULE**: If the title still contains the base subject (or a recognized synonym/abbreviation), it is the SAME course — regardless of qualifiers, subtitles, tools, focus areas, or context added to it. We do NOT want separate courses for each variant.\n\n  Examples of this rule:\n  - \"World War II: Normandy and D-Day\" → contains \"World War II\" → same course\n  - \"Python for Data Science\" → contains \"Python\" → same course\n  - \"IA Generativa\" → contains \"IA\" → same course\n  - \"Desarrollo Web con React\" → contains \"Desarrollo Web\" → same course\n  - \"ML with Python\" → contains \"ML\" → same course\n  - \"Differential Calculus\" → contains \"Calculus\" → same course\n  - \"Formula 1 Motorsport\" → contains \"Formula 1\" → same course\n\n  **When to EXCLUDE**:\n  - **Broader**: The title covers a larger domain that encompasses unrelated subjects → exclude. Example: \"Web Development\" is broader than \"Frontend Development\"; \"Programming\" is broader than \"Python\"; standalone \"Motorsport\" is broader than \"Formula 1\".\n  - **Standalone different subject**: The title drops the base subject entirely and represents something else → exclude. Example: \"React\" (no \"JavaScript\" in the title — it’s its own technology); \"Deep Learning\" (no \"Machine Learning\" — it’s its own field); \"Battle of Normandy\" (no \"World War II\" — it’s its own topic); standalone \"Motorsport\" (no \"Formula 1\").\n  - **Ambiguous**: The title could refer to multiple unrelated topics → exclude. Example: just \"Matrix\" without any disambiguator.\n\n  **Also include** (even without the base subject in the title):\n  - **Recognized synonyms/abbreviations**: \"WWII\" / \"Second World War\" ↔ \"World War II\"; \"F1\" ↔ \"Formula 1\"; \"ML\" ↔ \"Machine Learning\"; \"JS\" ↔ \"JavaScript\"; \"UI Development\" / \"Client-Side Development\" ↔ \"Frontend Development\".\n  - **Dialect/variant names**: \"Inglês Americano\", \"Inglês Britânico\", \"Optimisation\" vs \"Optimization\".\n  - **Language learning aspects**: \"Gramática Inglesa\", \"TOEFL\", \"Business English\" — all map to the same language course.\n  - **Light framing words**: \"principles\", \"fundamentals\", \"basics\", \"bootcamp\", \"certification prep\" — these don’t change the subject.\n  - **Descriptive disambiguators**: \"The Matrix (1999 film)\", \"Matrix Movie\" — these clarify which subject, they don’t change it.\n\n  Additional notes:\n  - Include different locale spellings when applicable (e.g., \"Optimization\" and \"Optimisation\").\n  - Include abbreviations if they mean the same thing (e.g., \"AI\"/\"IA\", \"ML\" when base is \"Machine Learning\").\n  - Levels like \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\", \"Calculus 1\", \"101\", etc., are acceptable.\n  - It’s fine to skip spacing/hyphenation/accents variants — serialization will handle those.\n  - Awkward or redundant phrasings are acceptable.\n  - Ignore casing issues (e.g., \"javascript\" vs \"JavaScript\").\n  - Well-known English terms in non-English titles are acceptable (e.g., \"Business English\" in Portuguese, \"TOEFL\", \"IELTS\").\n  - Ideally, it should have a huge list of alternative titles, really good ones have more than 100 alternative titles\n\n  SCORING CALIBRATION:\n  - Apply the CORE RULE above as the PRIMARY lens: does the title still contain the base subject? If yes → it’s the same course, do NOT penalize.\n  - Only penalize for titles that are genuinely broader (umbrella domain), a standalone different subject (base subject dropped entirely), or ambiguous.\n  - Do NOT penalize for qualifiers, subtitles, tools, focus areas, or context added to the base subject — these are all the same course.\n  - Do NOT heavily penalize for missing titles — only penalize for wrong inclusion/exclusion decisions.\n  - A large list is ideal but do NOT heavily penalize shorter lists if all included titles are correct.\n\n    ",
