  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Soil preparation involves physical and chemical considerations. Penalize if:\n   - Depth guidance is missing (tomatoes need deep, loose soil)\n   - Steps combine too many amendments without explaining when to add each\n\n2. TIMING CHECK: Penalize if:\n   - No mention of when to prepare soil relative to planting\n   - Watering the prepared bed is omitted\n\n3. SPECIFICITY CHECK: Penalize vague instructions like \"add fertilizer\" without specifying type, amount, or how to incorporate it.\n\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (READ THIS FIRST - CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing steps you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of steps - let complexity dictate length\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"ideal\" procedure\n- Do NOT interpret rules too literally - use common sense\n- Different valid procedures exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n- ONLY penalize for actual problems: incorrect sequence, factual errors, missing critical safety steps, or truly confusing instructions\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. PROCEDURAL ACCURACY: Steps must be in correct sequence. Penalize only if actions are genuinely out of order or skip critical prerequisites.\n\n2. ACTION-ORIENTED LANGUAGE: Each step must use imperative verbs (Click, Type, Add, Place, Turn, etc.). Penalize passive or purely descriptive language.\n\n3. LOGICAL STEP GROUPING: Steps should be coherent units that a user can follow without confusion. This does NOT mean micro-splitting every movement:\n   - ACCEPTABLE: \"Click the File name field and type your document name\" (filling a form field is ONE action)\n   - ACCEPTABLE: \"Pull over safely and turn on hazard lights\" (logically grouped safety actions)\n   - ACCEPTABLE: \"Pour hot water, swirl to warm, then discard\" (continuous motion)\n   - PROBLEMATIC: \"Download the file, install it, configure settings, and restart\" (unrelated actions crammed together)\n   The goal is clarity, not arbitrary splitting. If a step reads naturally and a user can follow it without confusion, it's fine.\n\n4. VERIFICATION POINTS: Where helpful, include confirmation of success. Only penalize if verification is missing for critical/risky actions. Do NOT penalize verification steps as \"padding\" - helping users confirm success is valuable teaching.\n\n5. FORMAT COMPLIANCE:\n   - title: Maximum 50 characters\n   - text: Maximum 300 characters\n\n6. SCOPE ADHERENCE: Content should cover the activity as described. Do not penalize for reasonable setup or verification steps.\n\n7. PRACTICAL FOCUS: Steps should be actionable instructions, not conceptual explanations.\n\nFINAL CHECK: Before penalizing anything, ask yourself: \"Would a reasonable human instructor consider this a genuine problem?\" If not, do not penalize.\n\n    ",
