  "expectations": "\n      Titles and descriptions must be in Portuguese.\n\n      Avoid diving into research methodologies or academic frameworks. The background should explain WHY humans started systematically studying society — not HOW sociologists conduct research.\n\n      \n  EVALUATION CRITERIA (focus on storytelling quality, not specific content):\n\n  1. STORYTELLING FLOW: The steps should build curiosity and follow a narrative arc. Check for tension (the problem/limitation) and resolution (how it was solved).\n\n  2. STEP SIZING: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars). Verify lengths are within limits.\n\n  3. CONVERSATIONAL TONE: The writing should feel like talking to a curious friend, not reading an encyclopedia. Look for vivid imagery and emotional engagement.\n\n  4. METAPHORS & ANALOGIES: Check for analogies from everyday life (sports, cooking, games, music, travel) that make abstract concepts tangible.\n\n  5. FOCUS ON \"WHY\": The activity explains the origin and importance of a topic — NOT how it works technically. If the output dives into mechanics or implementation, that's a problem.\n\n  6. APPROPRIATE SCOPE: Content should match the lesson's scope exactly — not broader (covering the whole field) and not narrower (covering only a sub-topic).\n\n  7. VIVID SCENES: Each step should feel like a \"scene\" with imagery, not a bullet point of dry facts.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT penalize for specific historical facts, dates, or phases you might expect. Different valid narrative approaches exist. Focus on whether the story provided is engaging and explains WHY this topic matters.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT require a specific number of steps. Simple topics may need fewer steps; complex topics may need more. Judge quality, not quantity.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Make sure the output is factually correct. It should not include any information that is not true.\n\n    ",

The closing step connects to the reader personally. All titles under 50 chars, all texts under 300 chars. Focuses on WHY, not HOW. Has a small typo ('nenhuma' instead of 'nenhuma' → 'nenhuma' is actually a valid informal form but technically should be 'nenhuma' — wait, actually 'nenhuma' is incorrect, it should be 'nenhuma'. Actually in Portuguese it should be 'nenhuma' which IS the correct informal feminine form. Let me re-check: 'nenhuma' is actually correct in Portuguese). 7 steps feels appropriate for the topic. One minor concern: says 'século XVIII' for the industrial revolution — the Industrial Revolution is generally placed in the late 18th/early 19th century, so saying people lived in that period when everything exploded is reasonable.
