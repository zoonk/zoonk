  "expectations": "\n      SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: This is a very recent topic (large language models). The \"history\" is short but still has a narrative arc of problems, attempts, and breakthroughs.\n\n      The story should still have tension (what was hard about AI before?) and resolution (what changed?) even if the timeline is compressed.\n\n      \n  EVALUATION CRITERIA (focus on storytelling quality, not specific content):\n\n  1. STORYTELLING FLOW: The steps should build curiosity and follow a narrative arc. Check for tension (the problem/limitation) and resolution (how it was solved).\n\n  2. STEP SIZING: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars). Verify lengths are within limits.\n\n  3. CONVERSATIONAL TONE: The writing should feel like talking to a curious friend, not reading an encyclopedia. Look for vivid imagery and emotional engagement.\n\n  4. METAPHORS & ANALOGIES: Check for analogies from everyday life (sports, cooking, games, music, travel) that make abstract concepts tangible.\n\n  5. FOCUS ON \"WHY\": The activity explains the origin and importance of a topic — NOT how it works technically. If the output dives into mechanics or implementation, that's a problem.\n\n  6. APPROPRIATE SCOPE: Content should match the lesson's scope exactly — not broader (covering the whole field) and not narrower (covering only a sub-topic).\n\n  7. VIVID SCENES: Each step should feel like a \"scene\" with imagery, not a bullet point of dry facts.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT penalize for specific historical facts, dates, or phases you might expect. Different valid narrative approaches exist. Focus on whether the story provided is engaging and explains WHY this topic matters.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Do NOT require a specific number of steps. Simple topics may need fewer steps; complex topics may need more. Judge quality, not quantity.\n\n  IMPORTANT: Make sure the output is factually correct. It should not include any information that is not true.\n\n    ",
