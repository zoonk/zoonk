  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Feedback loop examples must genuinely involve circular causation. Penalize if:\n   - Examples describe simple cause-effect chains without feedback\n   - Positive and negative feedback are conflated or mislabeled\n\n2. CONTEXT CHECK: Penalize if examples are limited to engineering/biology. Feedback loops appear in social media, economics, relationships, climate, habits, and organizational behavior.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT feedback loops are (outputs affecting inputs). This should show WHERE feedback dynamics shape systems and behaviors around us.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE: Examples must be concrete, recognizable situations from everyday life. Penalize abstract or theoretical applications without clear real-world grounding.\n\n2. CONTEXT DIVERSITY: Content should show the topic across different life domains (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected places, personal interests). Variety helps different learners connect.\n\n3. RECOGNITION FACTOR: Examples should create \"aha moments\" — helping learners see the topic in familiar places they hadn't noticed before.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like pointing out hidden patterns in everyday life. Include metaphors and analogies from familiar activities.\n\n6. FOCUS: Shows WHERE something appears (real-world contexts), not WHAT it is (definitions) or HOW it works (processes).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific life domains or contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of contexts or examples\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" list of applications\n- ONLY penalize for: incorrect real-world claims, abstract examples without concrete situations, overlap with explanation content, or lack of variety in context types\n- Different valid sets of examples exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

It provides 12 examples with excellent context diversity spanning: targeted advertising, sleep habits, remote meetings, home thermostats, panic buying, viral music, cruise control, interpersonal communication, neighborhood trends, financial markets, social media psychology, and forest ecology. Each example genuinely demonstrates circular causation. The positive/negative feedback distinction is clear and accurate. Strong 'aha moment' factor with relatable examples like 'The Muted Meeting Mystery' - an unexpected angle. Good conversational tone with second-person address.
