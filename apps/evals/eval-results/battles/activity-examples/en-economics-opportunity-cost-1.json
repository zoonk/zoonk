  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Opportunity cost examples must correctly identify what's being given up. Penalize if:\n   - Examples confuse sunk costs with opportunity costs\n   - The \"next best alternative\" concept is missing or incorrectly applied\n\n2. CONTEXT CHECK: Penalize if examples are limited to money. Opportunity cost applies to time, attention, energy, relationships, career paths, and any scarce resource allocation.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT opportunity cost is (the value of the next best alternative). This should show WHERE we unconsciously make trade-offs daily.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE: Examples must be concrete, recognizable situations from everyday life. Penalize abstract or theoretical applications without clear real-world grounding.\n\n2. CONTEXT DIVERSITY: Content should show the topic across different life domains (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected places, personal interests). Variety helps different learners connect.\n\n3. RECOGNITION FACTOR: Examples should create \"aha moments\" — helping learners see the topic in familiar places they hadn't noticed before.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like pointing out hidden patterns in everyday life. Include metaphors and analogies from familiar activities.\n\n6. FOCUS: Shows WHERE something appears (real-world contexts), not WHAT it is (definitions) or HOW it works (processes).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific life domains or contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of contexts or examples\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" list of applications\n- ONLY penalize for: incorrect real-world claims, abstract examples without concrete situations, overlap with explanation content, or lack of variety in context types\n- Different valid sets of examples exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

It provides 8 well-crafted examples spanning diverse life domains: social media/leisure (late-night scroll), workplace (free perk, meeting invite), entertainment (streaming), finance (savings), career (internship), daily choices (coffee), and gaming. Every example correctly applies opportunity cost with clear 'next best alternative' framing - never confusing sunk costs. The writing is consistently conversational with excellent metaphors ('your schedule is a trade-off machine', 'convenience has a receipt'). Recognition factor is high with genuine 'aha moments' (free work perks costing gym time, free games costing 'nothing and everything'). All titles under 50 chars, all text under 300 chars. Focuses on WHERE, not WHAT. Only minor weakness: could benefit from one more unexpected domain.",

Good concrete quantification in examples (e.g., $30/hour side gig).
