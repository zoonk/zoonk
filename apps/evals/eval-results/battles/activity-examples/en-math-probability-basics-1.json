  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Probability examples must reflect genuine statistical reasoning. Penalize if:\n   - Examples confuse probability with certainty (e.g., \"you will definitely win\" vs. \"you have a 50% chance\")\n   - Real-world probability claims are mathematically implausible for the context\n\n2. CONTEXT CHECK: Penalize if examples are limited to gambling/games. Probability appears in medicine, weather, insurance, dating, sports, business decisions, and daily risk assessment.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT probability is (ratios, likelihood, sample spaces). This should show WHERE probability thinking appears in familiar life situations.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE: Examples must be concrete, recognizable situations from everyday life. Penalize abstract or theoretical applications without clear real-world grounding.\n\n2. CONTEXT DIVERSITY: Content should show the topic across different life domains (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected places, personal interests). Variety helps different learners connect.\n\n3. RECOGNITION FACTOR: Examples should create \"aha moments\" — helping learners see the topic in familiar places they hadn't noticed before.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like pointing out hidden patterns in everyday life. Include metaphors and analogies from familiar activities.\n\n6. FOCUS: Shows WHERE something appears (real-world contexts), not WHAT it is (definitions) or HOW it works (processes).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific life domains or contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of contexts or examples\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" list of applications\n- ONLY penalize for: incorrect real-world claims, abstract examples without concrete situations, overlap with explanation content, or lack of variety in context types\n- Different valid sets of examples exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
