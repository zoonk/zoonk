  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Titles and text must be in Portuguese.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Dopamine examples must reflect current neuroscience accurately. Penalize if:\n   - Dopamine is oversimplified as just \"the pleasure chemical\" (it's about motivation/reward prediction)\n   - Examples attribute behaviors to dopamine that involve multiple neurotransmitter systems\n\n2. CONTEXT CHECK: Penalize if examples are limited to addiction. Dopamine is involved in motivation, learning, movement, social behavior, creativity, and goal-directed action.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT dopamine is (a neurotransmitter involved in reward). This should show WHERE dopamine influences behaviors and experiences in daily life.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE: Examples must be concrete, recognizable situations from everyday life. Penalize abstract or theoretical applications without clear real-world grounding.\n\n2. CONTEXT DIVERSITY: Content should show the topic across different life domains (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected places, personal interests). Variety helps different learners connect.\n\n3. RECOGNITION FACTOR: Examples should create \"aha moments\" — helping learners see the topic in familiar places they hadn't noticed before.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like pointing out hidden patterns in everyday life. Include metaphors and analogies from familiar activities.\n\n6. FOCUS: Shows WHERE something appears (real-world contexts), not WHAT it is (definitions) or HOW it works (processes).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific life domains or contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of contexts or examples\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" list of applications\n- ONLY penalize for: incorrect real-world claims, abstract examples without concrete situations, overlap with explanation content, or lack of variety in context types\n- Different valid sets of examples exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

(2) Good context diversity across daily life, work, entertainment, physical activity, and planning. (3) Conversational tone with relatable scenarios. (4) Avoids oversimplifying dopamine as 'the pleasure chemical' — mentions anticipation, reward prediction, and motivation. (5) All titles under 50 chars and texts under 300 chars. (6) Doesn't overlap with explanation content (focuses on WHERE, not WHAT). (7) No addiction framing. Minor weakness: doesn't explicitly mention the word 'dopamina' in every step (step 2 avoids it, which is fine for conversational tone but slightly less educational). The step about work ('Avanços que empurram') is slightly more abstract than others. Overall, very strong and scientifically grounded.",
