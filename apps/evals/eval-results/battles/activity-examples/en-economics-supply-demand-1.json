  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Supply and demand examples must reflect genuine economic dynamics. Penalize if:\n   - Price changes are attributed to single-cause explanations when multiple factors interact\n   - Examples suggest prices are arbitrarily set rather than emerging from market forces\n\n2. CONTEXT CHECK: Penalize if examples are limited to obvious retail. Supply and demand affects housing, labor markets, dating, time allocation, attention economics, and even social status.\n\n3. DISTINCTION FROM EXPLANATION: The explanation covered WHAT supply and demand curves are. This should show WHERE these forces visibly shape real-world situations.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. REAL-WORLD RELEVANCE: Examples must be concrete, recognizable situations from everyday life. Penalize abstract or theoretical applications without clear real-world grounding.\n\n2. CONTEXT DIVERSITY: Content should show the topic across different life domains (daily life, work, entertainment, unexpected places, personal interests). Variety helps different learners connect.\n\n3. RECOGNITION FACTOR: Examples should create \"aha moments\" — helping learners see the topic in familiar places they hadn't noticed before.\n\n4. FORMAT: Each step must have a title (max 50 chars) and text (max 300 chars).\n\n5. TONE: Conversational, like pointing out hidden patterns in everyday life. Include metaphors and analogies from familiar activities.\n\n6. FOCUS: Shows WHERE something appears (real-world contexts), not WHAT it is (definitions) or HOW it works (processes).\n\n7. NO OVERLAP: Must not repeat content from the EXPLANATION_STEPS which covered the WHAT.\n\n8. SCOPE: Content matches the lesson scope exactly.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific life domains or contexts you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of contexts or examples\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" list of applications\n- ONLY penalize for: incorrect real-world claims, abstract examples without concrete situations, overlap with explanation content, or lack of variety in context types\n- Different valid sets of examples exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

Strong recognition factor with familiar scenarios like 'corner gas station wars' and coffee shop price testing. All examples show genuine economic dynamics with multi-factor explanations (e.g., iPhone example shows both initial scarcity AND how prices crash as supply increases). Includes non-obvious contexts (food trucks at events, Black Friday loss leader strategy). Format complies with requirements. Conversational tone throughout. No overlap with explanation content - focuses on WHERE not WHAT. Minor weakness: slightly retail-heavy despite good variety, but each example is concrete and recognizable.",

Airline pricing example shows dynamic adjustment well. Format compliant. Conversational tone.

However, some explanations are slightly confused - the Friday pizza example says 'price stays same' which is atypical for supply/demand illustration and weakens the point.

Back-to-school example focuses more on retailer behavior than price dynamics. Missing housing, labor markets, or any unexpected contexts. Conversational tone is adequate but less engaging.
