  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE: English output required.\n\nTOPIC: German vocabulary for parents and siblings - focused specifically on immediate family members (mother, father, brother, sister, and their variations).\n\nSCRIPT: Roman (romanization should be empty string \"\")\n\nTOPIC SCOPE: This is a narrow, focused lesson. Vocabulary should include:\n- Parents (mother, father, mom, dad, step-parents)\n- Siblings (brother, sister, half-siblings, step-siblings)\n- Related terms (older, younger, twin, only child)\n- Do NOT expect extended family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) - those belong in separate lessons\n\nACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize SEVERELY if:\n- Parent/sibling terms are mistranslated (Mutter=mother, Vater=father, Bruder=brother, Schwester=sister)\n- Vocabulary includes extended family members (this lesson is specifically about parents and siblings)\n- German articles (der/die/das) are missing from nouns\n- Romanization contains any text (should be empty string)\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. TOPIC-APPROPRIATE COVERAGE: The vocabulary list should cover the narrow lesson topic appropriately.\n   - Include words directly relevant to the specific lesson focus\n   - A narrow topic (like \"Ordering Coffee\") needs fewer words than a broad one\n   - Do NOT penalize for vocabulary count - focus on relevance and quality\n   - Do NOT expect exhaustive coverage of the broader domain (e.g., don't expect all food words for a coffee-ordering lesson)\n\n2. TRANSLATION ACCURACY (CRITICAL - highest priority):\n   - Each word-translation pair MUST be linguistically accurate\n   - Consider regional variations (Brazilian Portuguese vs European, Latin American Spanish vs Castilian)\n   - The translation must match the EXACT meaning - not a broader category or related concept\n   - If a translation is incorrect or semantically imprecise, this is a SEVERE error\n   - Grammatical gender must be correct (masculine nouns with masculine articles, feminine with feminine)\n\n3. ROMANIZATION (required field):\n   - For Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, Greek, Thai, Hindi, etc.: romanization MUST contain the Roman letter representation\n   - Use standard romanization (romaji for Japanese, pinyin for Chinese, etc.)\n   - For Roman-script languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.): romanization MUST be an empty string \"\"\n   - Penalize if romanization is missing for non-Roman scripts or contains text for Roman scripts\n\n4. TOPIC FOCUS (STRICT BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT): Words must be INSIDE the lesson's specific scope. Penalize SEVERELY if:\n   - Vocabulary includes words from adjacent but separate topics (e.g., adjectives when the lesson is about nouns)\n   - Words drift to related but out-of-scope categories (e.g., wild animals for a pets lesson)\n   - The output includes vocabulary that belongs in a DIFFERENT lesson on a related topic\n   - Words are \"helpful additions\" that expand beyond the defined lesson boundary\n\n5. VOCABULARY QUALITY: Words should be practical and commonly used. Penalize if:\n   - Words are obscure, archaic, or rarely used in everyday speech\n   - Words include profanity, slurs, or offensive content\n   - Words use non-standard loanwords that are not common in the target language\n\n6. LANGUAGE CORRECTNESS: Output language must match NATIVE_LANGUAGE code.\n   - Translations should be in the learner's native language\n   - Words being tested should be in the target language\n   - Penalize if languages are mixed incorrectly\n\n7. GRAMMATICAL GENDER AND ARTICLES:\n   - For languages with grammatical gender, nouns MUST include articles\n   - German: \"die Mutter\", \"der Vater\", \"das Kind\" (not \"Mutter\", \"Vater\", \"Kind\")\n   - French: \"le pain\", \"la maison\" (not \"pain\", \"maison\")\n   - Spanish: \"el gato\", \"la casa\" (not \"gato\", \"casa\")\n   - Portuguese: \"o livro\", \"a mesa\" (not \"livro\", \"mesa\")\n   - Italian: \"il gatto\", \"la casa\" (not \"gatto\", \"casa\")\n   - Penalize if nouns are shown without their articles in gendered languages\n   - Penalize if the grammatical gender is WRONG (e.g., masculine article with feminine noun)\n\n8. NO DUPLICATES: The `word` field is the unique identifier - duplicates are determined by the word field ONLY, not translations. Penalize if:\n   - The same word appears multiple times in the `word` field (even with different translations)\n   - Near-duplicates exist (same word with minor formatting differences)\n   - Semantic duplicates exist (same concept repeated with different phrasing)\n   - A word appears twice because it has multiple valid translations (should appear once with most common translation)\n\n9. CLEAN WORD FIELD - NO PARENTHETICAL CONTENT: The word field must contain ONLY the vocabulary word. Penalize SEVERELY if:\n   - The word field contains parenthetical disambiguation like \"el cafe (la bebida)\"\n   - The word field contains usage notes, alternative meanings, or pronunciation hints in parentheses\n   - Any text in parentheses appears in the word field (this breaks text-to-speech)\n\n10. NO OVER-ENUMERATION OF VARIANTS: Vocabulary should be representative, not exhaustive. Penalize if:\n   - Multiple variants of the same base item are listed when 1-2 would suffice\n   - The list appears inflated with excessive sub-types of a single category\n   - A base concept is represented by 5+ specific variants instead of the base term plus 1-2 examples\n   - The vocabulary count seems artificially high due to listing every possible variant\n   NOTE: This does NOT mean penalize for having many words - penalize only when those words are redundant variants of the same concept. Distinct vocabulary items are fine.\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for specific word choices - accept ANY valid vocabulary relevant to the topic\n- Do NOT penalize for not including words you might expect - only penalize for actual errors\n- Do NOT require specific vocabulary items by name\n- Do NOT expect a specific number of words - narrow topics naturally have fewer words\n- FOCUS ON: translation accuracy, romanization correctness (when applicable), topic relevance, no duplicates, clean word fields\n- Different valid vocabulary selections exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
