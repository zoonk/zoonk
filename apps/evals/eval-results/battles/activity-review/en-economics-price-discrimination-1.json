  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in English.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Economic pricing and market concepts must be accurate. Penalize if:\n   - Price discrimination types are incorrectly described\n   - Consumer/producer surplus calculations are wrong\n   - Elasticity effects are backwards (e.g., claiming inelastic demand means large quantity changes)\n   - Market equilibrium mechanics are misrepresented\n\n2. TRANSFER CHECK: The inputs discuss airline tickets, movie theaters, and specific pricing examples. Questions must use completely different scenarios (e.g., concert venues, software licensing, professional services) to test the same concepts.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHECK: Look for questions that connect WHY price discrimination exists (profit maximization, consumer heterogeneity) with HOW firms segment markets and WHERE different strategies appear.\n\n4. MISCONCEPTION CHECK: Distractors should include common economics misconceptions like:\n   - Thinking lower prices always increase revenue\n   - Confusing price discrimination with illegal pricing\n   - Believing all customers pay the same \"fair\" price\n   - Misunderstanding the relationship between elasticity and pricing power\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\nSEVERITY GUIDE - Use this to calibrate your scoring:\n\nSEVERE ISSUES (heavy penalty):\n- Factual errors or hallucination (inventing facts not in the input)\n- Testing pure memorization (\"What metaphor did the text use?\")\n- Questions that reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" or similar meta-language\n- Wrong tone (stiff, academic, exam-like instead of conversational)\n- Format violations (wrong question count, missing fields, multiple correct answers)\n- Distractors that are obviously absurd or unrelated\n- Language purity violations (mixing languages)\n\nMODERATE ISSUES (medium penalty):\n- Coverage heavily skewed to one content type (e.g., 15 HOW questions, 0 WHY)\n- No integration questions connecting multiple content types\n- Feedback that just says \"correct/incorrect\" without insight\n- Questions answerable without understanding (too easy)\n\nMINOR ISSUES (light penalty or just note):\n- Reusing a scenario from the input (not ideal, but okay if the question still tests understanding)\n- Some questions slightly easier than others\n- Feedback could be friendlier but is still helpful\n- Minor missed opportunities for deeper insight\n\n1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Questions must be factually correct. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions contain factual errors or hallucinated information\n   - Correct answers are actually wrong based on the input content\n   - Feedback explains concepts incorrectly\n\n2. UNDERSTANDING VS MEMORIZATION: Questions must test thinking, not recall. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions ask \"What did the text say?\" or \"Which example was used?\"\n   - Questions reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" \"according to the text\"\n   - Questions can be answered by pattern-matching phrases from the input\n\n3. TONE & STYLE: Must feel conversational and friendly. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Language is stiff, formal, or exam-like\n   - Feedback sounds academic or preachy\n   - Questions use unexplained jargon\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Must meet structural requirements. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Question count outside 15-20 range\n   - Missing required fields or wrong types\n   - Multiple correct answers per question\n   - Character limits exceeded\n\n5. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: Wrong answers must be plausible. Penalize if:\n   - Distractors are obviously absurd or unrelated\n   - The correct answer is obvious without understanding\n   - Distractors don't represent real misconceptions\n\n6. CONTENT COVERAGE: Should test across content types. Penalize if:\n   - Any content type (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHERE) is completely missing\n   - Coverage is heavily skewed\n\n7. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Should guide learning. Penalize if:\n   - Feedback just says \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" without insight\n   - Wrong answer feedback doesn't point toward the correct answer\n\n8. SCENARIO FRESHNESS (MINOR): Prefer novel scenarios, but don't heavily penalize reuse.\n   - Ideal: Questions use fresh scenarios not in the input\n   - Acceptable: Reusing input scenarios IF the question still tests understanding\n   - Only penalize if reused scenario makes the question pure recall\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT heavily penalize scenario reuse if the question still tests understanding\n- Do NOT require specific concepts to be tested by name\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" set of questions\n- FOCUS penalties on: factual errors, memorization-based questions, wrong tone, format violations\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
