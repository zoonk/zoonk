  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in English.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Behavioral economics concepts must be accurate. Penalize if:\n   - Heuristics are incorrectly described or conflated\n   - Loss aversion is confused with risk aversion\n   - Framing effects are misrepresented\n   - The distinction between System 1 and System 2 thinking is wrong\n\n2. TRANSFER CHECK: The inputs discuss investment decisions and product pricing. Questions must use completely different scenarios (e.g., health choices, environmental behavior, relationship decisions) to test the same concepts.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHECK: This is an interdisciplinary topic. Look for questions that connect WHY biases exist (evolutionary psychology, cognitive limitations) with HOW they operate (heuristics, framing) and WHERE they affect decisions across domains.\n\n4. MISCONCEPTION CHECK: Distractors should include common behavioral economics misconceptions like:\n   - Thinking biases only affect unintelligent people\n   - Believing awareness of bias eliminates its effect\n   - Confusing heuristics (shortcuts) with errors (biases)\n   - Assuming rational choice theory accurately predicts behavior\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\nSEVERITY GUIDE - Use this to calibrate your scoring:\n\nSEVERE ISSUES (heavy penalty):\n- Factual errors or hallucination (inventing facts not in the input)\n- Testing pure memorization (\"What metaphor did the text use?\")\n- Questions that reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" or similar meta-language\n- Wrong tone (stiff, academic, exam-like instead of conversational)\n- Format violations (wrong question count, missing fields, multiple correct answers)\n- Distractors that are obviously absurd or unrelated\n- Language purity violations (mixing languages)\n\nMODERATE ISSUES (medium penalty):\n- Coverage heavily skewed to one content type (e.g., 15 HOW questions, 0 WHY)\n- No integration questions connecting multiple content types\n- Feedback that just says \"correct/incorrect\" without insight\n- Questions answerable without understanding (too easy)\n\nMINOR ISSUES (light penalty or just note):\n- Reusing a scenario from the input (not ideal, but okay if the question still tests understanding)\n- Some questions slightly easier than others\n- Feedback could be friendlier but is still helpful\n- Minor missed opportunities for deeper insight\n\n1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Questions must be factually correct. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions contain factual errors or hallucinated information\n   - Correct answers are actually wrong based on the input content\n   - Feedback explains concepts incorrectly\n\n2. UNDERSTANDING VS MEMORIZATION: Questions must test thinking, not recall. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions ask \"What did the text say?\" or \"Which example was used?\"\n   - Questions reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" \"according to the text\"\n   - Questions can be answered by pattern-matching phrases from the input\n\n3. TONE & STYLE: Must feel conversational and friendly. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Language is stiff, formal, or exam-like\n   - Feedback sounds academic or preachy\n   - Questions use unexplained jargon\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Must meet structural requirements. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Question count outside 15-20 range\n   - Missing required fields or wrong types\n   - Multiple correct answers per question\n   - Character limits exceeded\n\n5. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: Wrong answers must be plausible. Penalize if:\n   - Distractors are obviously absurd or unrelated\n   - The correct answer is obvious without understanding\n   - Distractors don't represent real misconceptions\n\n6. CONTENT COVERAGE: Should test across content types. Penalize if:\n   - Any content type (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHERE) is completely missing\n   - Coverage is heavily skewed\n\n7. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Should guide learning. Penalize if:\n   - Feedback just says \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" without insight\n   - Wrong answer feedback doesn't point toward the correct answer\n\n8. SCENARIO FRESHNESS (MINOR): Prefer novel scenarios, but don't heavily penalize reuse.\n   - Ideal: Questions use fresh scenarios not in the input\n   - Acceptable: Reusing input scenarios IF the question still tests understanding\n   - Only penalize if reused scenario makes the question pure recall\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT heavily penalize scenario reuse if the question still tests understanding\n- Do NOT require specific concepts to be tested by name\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" set of questions\n- FOCUS penalties on: factual errors, memorization-based questions, wrong tone, format violations\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

The tone is quite terse - feedback like 'Right —', 'No —', 'Yes —' feels more like shorthand than conversational. Questions themselves are short ('Why small tweaks help?', 'Which mechanism explains this?'). While concepts are accurate, the brevity of feedback sometimes limits learning value - e.g., 'Wrong — fines restrict or punish' doesn't fully explain the principle. Some scenarios are fresh (bridge collapse, energy bills, jacket pricing, organ donation). The left-digit bias question is a good addition not seen in other models. However, the overly compressed style makes feedback less insightful and the experience feels more like a rapid-fire quiz than an engaging learning activity.
