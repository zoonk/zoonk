  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: All content must be in English.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. ACCURACY CHECK: Database transaction concepts must be technically accurate. Penalize if:\n   - ACID properties are incorrectly described or conflated\n   - Isolation levels are misrepresented (e.g., claiming serializable has no overhead)\n   - Deadlock causes or prevention strategies are wrong\n   - Atomicity is confused with durability\n\n2. TRANSFER CHECK: The inputs discuss banking transfers, inventory systems, and specific examples. Questions must use completely different scenarios (e.g., airline reservations, multiplayer games, collaborative editing) to test the same concepts.\n\n3. INTEGRATION CHECK: Look for questions that connect WHY transactions exist (data integrity problems) with HOW they work (locking, logging) and WHERE they apply (novel systems).\n\n4. MISCONCEPTION CHECK: Distractors should include common database misconceptions like:\n   - Thinking transactions automatically prevent all data issues\n   - Confusing isolation with atomicity\n   - Believing higher isolation levels are always better\n   - Misunderstanding when locks are acquired vs released\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\nSEVERITY GUIDE - Use this to calibrate your scoring:\n\nSEVERE ISSUES (heavy penalty):\n- Factual errors or hallucination (inventing facts not in the input)\n- Testing pure memorization (\"What metaphor did the text use?\")\n- Questions that reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" or similar meta-language\n- Wrong tone (stiff, academic, exam-like instead of conversational)\n- Format violations (wrong question count, missing fields, multiple correct answers)\n- Distractors that are obviously absurd or unrelated\n- Language purity violations (mixing languages)\n\nMODERATE ISSUES (medium penalty):\n- Coverage heavily skewed to one content type (e.g., 15 HOW questions, 0 WHY)\n- No integration questions connecting multiple content types\n- Feedback that just says \"correct/incorrect\" without insight\n- Questions answerable without understanding (too easy)\n\nMINOR ISSUES (light penalty or just note):\n- Reusing a scenario from the input (not ideal, but okay if the question still tests understanding)\n- Some questions slightly easier than others\n- Feedback could be friendlier but is still helpful\n- Minor missed opportunities for deeper insight\n\n1. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Questions must be factually correct. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions contain factual errors or hallucinated information\n   - Correct answers are actually wrong based on the input content\n   - Feedback explains concepts incorrectly\n\n2. UNDERSTANDING VS MEMORIZATION: Questions must test thinking, not recall. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Questions ask \"What did the text say?\" or \"Which example was used?\"\n   - Questions reference \"the lesson,\" \"as explained,\" \"according to the text\"\n   - Questions can be answered by pattern-matching phrases from the input\n\n3. TONE & STYLE: Must feel conversational and friendly. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Language is stiff, formal, or exam-like\n   - Feedback sounds academic or preachy\n   - Questions use unexplained jargon\n\n4. FORMAT COMPLIANCE: Must meet structural requirements. SEVERELY penalize if:\n   - Question count outside 15-20 range\n   - Missing required fields or wrong types\n   - Multiple correct answers per question\n   - Character limits exceeded\n\n5. DISTRACTOR QUALITY: Wrong answers must be plausible. Penalize if:\n   - Distractors are obviously absurd or unrelated\n   - The correct answer is obvious without understanding\n   - Distractors don't represent real misconceptions\n\n6. CONTENT COVERAGE: Should test across content types. Penalize if:\n   - Any content type (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHERE) is completely missing\n   - Coverage is heavily skewed\n\n7. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Should guide learning. Penalize if:\n   - Feedback just says \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" without insight\n   - Wrong answer feedback doesn't point toward the correct answer\n\n8. SCENARIO FRESHNESS (MINOR): Prefer novel scenarios, but don't heavily penalize reuse.\n   - Ideal: Questions use fresh scenarios not in the input\n   - Acceptable: Reusing input scenarios IF the question still tests understanding\n   - Only penalize if reused scenario makes the question pure recall\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT heavily penalize scenario reuse if the question still tests understanding\n- Do NOT require specific concepts to be tested by name\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" set of questions\n- FOCUS penalties on: factual errors, memorization-based questions, wrong tone, format violations\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

Technical accuracy is strong - ACID properties are correctly explained, isolation levels are properly described with tradeoffs, deadlock causes/resolution are accurate. Questions test understanding rather than memorization, using novel scenarios to probe the same concepts from the input. Distractors are plausible and represent real misconceptions (e.g., confusing isolation with atomicity, thinking higher isolation is always better). Feedback is conversational and educational, explaining WHY the answer is right/wrong. Good integration across content types (WHY transactions exist, HOW they work mechanically, WHAT properties mean, WHERE they apply).

Technical accuracy is solid - correctly distinguishes ACID properties, explains write-ahead logging, handles deadlock vs starvation distinction well. Questions integrate multiple concepts (e.g., Q1 asks about atomicity AND durability together). Distractors are plausible and test real misconceptions. Feedback is helpful and conversational. Q11 about temporary violations inside transactions before commit is a sophisticated question testing deeper understanding. Good coverage across WHY/WHAT/HOW/WHERE.

Questions avoid memorization and test conceptual understanding. Distractors are plausible. However, 15 questions is at the minimum of the 15-20 range.

Q14 about the 'gold standard' of ACID is a bit abstract but still valid. Good integration of WHY (Q5 on historical problems) and WHERE (various application scenarios).
