  "expectations": "\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATION: This is an edge case - a visual/practical skill where understanding is demonstrated through application to real scenarios, not visual recognition.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Photography scenarios where learners must decide subject placement to achieve specific visual effects\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring understanding of WHY off-center placement creates visual interest\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to define the rule of thirds or describe the grid without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions about \"power points\" terminology without practical application\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Rule of thirds being mandatory (it's a guideline, not a rule - breaking it intentionally can be effective)\n   - Centered subjects always being wrong (centered composition works for symmetry and certain moods)\n   - The grid being visible in final photos (it's an imaginary guide)\n   - Rule of thirds being the only composition technique (leading lines, framing, and many others exist)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works for \"where would you place the subject\" scenarios. Match columns could connect composition choices to their visual effects. AVOID selectImage unless visual recognition is truly being tested.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

(5) The matchColumns format is well-suited, connecting composition choices to visual effects.

(7) The fillBlank question tests understanding of grid structure but is somewhat definitional/recall-based. (8) Conversational, clear tone throughout. Minor issues: The fillBlank is more recall than application ('two', 'two', 'nine', 'intersect' are pure facts). One could argue selectImage with text prompts is odd.

(4) The soccer player question nicely tests directional space concept. (5) The 'new photographer' question indirectly addresses that centering isn't always wrong ('centering ensures your subject is included'). (6) Conversational tone throughout. Issues: (1) The fillBlank question is somewhat memorization-heavy with specific vocabulary ('subject placement', 'scan', 'somewhere to travel'). (2) Option B in Q1 (horizon question) has a factual error - the feedback says 'upper line pushes ground to bottom third' but the option says 'upper horizontal line so ground takes up less space.' Wait - actually this has a significant accuracy issue. If the horizon is on the UPPER horizontal line, the ground takes up MORE space (2/3), not less. The correct answer should be placing the horizon on the LOWER line to emphasize sky. This is a factual error in Q1. Actually, re-reading: 'Along the upper horizontal line, so the ground takes up less space' - the upper line means the horizon is high, so ground takes up 2/3... wait. If the horizon is placed along the upper third line, that means sky is 1/3 and ground is 2/3. The feedback says 'placing the horizon on the upper line pushes ground to bottom third' which is wrong. This is a significant factual error that undermines the quiz. Actually, I need to reconsider. 'Upper horizontal line' - in a 3x3 grid, the upper horizontal line is at 1/3 from the top. If the horizon sits there, the sky occupies the top 1/3 and ground occupies bottom 2/3. So the correct answer should be placing horizon on the LOWER line (2/3 from top) to emphasize sky. But Model F marks the upper line as correct... Wait, I'm re-reading. Model F Q1 marks 'Along the upper horizontal line, so the ground takes up less space' as CORRECT. But this is wrong - upper horizon = more ground, less sky. This is backwards. Significant factual error. However, looking more carefully at Model B which has a similar question - Model B also gets confused here. Let me re-examine Model F's Q1 more carefully. Actually, there's genuine ambiguity here about what 'upper horizontal line' means in context. If we think of the grid lines as dividing the frame into thirds, the 'lower horizontal line' is at 1/3 from the bottom (or 2/3 from the top). Placing the horizon there means sky gets 2/3 of the frame. This is the standard answer. Model F marks 'Along the upper horizontal line' as correct for emphasizing sky, which is wrong. This is a factual error. Dropping score.",
