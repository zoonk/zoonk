  "expectations": "\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATION: This is an edge case - an abstract psychological concept where understanding means recognizing the bias in everyday situations.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Everyday scenarios where learners must recognize confirmation bias operating in someone's reasoning\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring understanding of WHY the bias is unconscious and hard to overcome\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to define confirmation bias or list its characteristics without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions about the sports fan or political supporter examples from the explanation\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Confirmation bias being intentional deception (it's usually unconscious)\n   - Only unintelligent people having confirmation bias (everyone is susceptible, including experts)\n   - Confirmation bias being easy to overcome once you know about it (awareness helps but doesn't eliminate it)\n   - Confirmation bias only affecting beliefs about facts (it affects emotional and value-based beliefs too)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice excels here - present scenarios and ask which demonstrates the bias. Match columns could connect cognitive biases to example scenarios. AVOID sort_order as the concept isn't sequential.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

Multiple choice questions are appropriately used with rich, detailed scenarios (Maya's organic food belief, James's investment memory, pharmaceutical trial, detective Lisa). The matchColumns format connects real-world situations to bias aspects effectively. The fillBlank tests conceptual understanding of the mechanism. The sortOrder, while noted as problematic in guidance, is actually appropriate here since it tests understanding of the psychological sequence (belief → encounter → discomfort → filtering → reinforcement). Feedback is outstanding - detailed explanations for both correct and incorrect answers that explain WHY. No factual errors - correctly emphasizes the unconscious nature of the bias, that experts are susceptible, and that awareness doesn't eliminate it. Questions are clear and conversational.
