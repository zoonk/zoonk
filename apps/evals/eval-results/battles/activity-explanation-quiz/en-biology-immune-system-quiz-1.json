  "expectations": "\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Scenarios where someone observes immune responses in everyday life (repeat exposure, recovery time, vaccination effects) and must explain the underlying mechanism\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations requiring prediction of immune outcomes based on understanding defense layers\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to name cells, list defense mechanisms, or recall definitions without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing specific metaphors or examples from the explanation\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Antibodies directly killing pathogens (they MARK pathogens for destruction by other cells like macrophages)\n   - White blood cells being a single type (there are many types with different functions)\n   - Immune response being immediate (innate response is fast, adaptive takes days)\n   - Fever being harmful (it's often a beneficial immune response)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Multiple choice works well for \"which scenario shows X mechanism.\" Match columns work for connecting symptoms to immune responses. Sort order works for immune response sequence.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

The fill-blank with 4 blanks is ambitious but works. The matchColumns effectively connects observations to principles.

One minor concern: Q1 feedback for the memory option says 'The memory system takes days to ramp up' — this is slightly misleading since the memory response is actually faster than the primary adaptive response; it's the initial adaptive response that takes days.

The matchColumns right-side answers are very technical and jargon-heavy ('Macrophage phagocytosis — innate cellular response').

The task guidance specifically warns against 'questions referencing specific metaphors or examples from the explanation' — while these are new metaphors, the approach of testing through metaphor-matching is weaker than testing through real-world biological scenarios. The matchColumns pairs abstract items (Sticky Tape, Photo Archive, Pac-Man, Castle Wall) with immune components, which again tests analogy-matching. The sortOrder and fill-blank are more straightforward. The fill-blank answer 'shape' for antibody recognition is good. Feedback quality is adequate but sometimes brief.

Antibodies mark invaders but don't engulf them.' These don't explain reasoning deeply or provide additional insight, which the task specifically requires. Q1's correct answer and scenario are somewhat unclear — the question asks what protects first but the scenario mentions 'before any swelling happens,' and the correct answer about 'physical barriers' working 'right away' is a bit confusing since the skin is already broken.

Also the sort-order feedback says responses happen 'simultaneously' while presenting a strict sequence, which can confuse learners about timing/overlap.",
