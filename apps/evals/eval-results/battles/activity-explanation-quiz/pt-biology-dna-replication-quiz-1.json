  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Questions, options, and feedback must be in Portuguese.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Scenarios requiring understanding of WHY replication works as it does (directionality constraints, error correction needs)\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations where learners must predict outcomes of replication errors or enzyme malfunctions\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to name enzymes or describe their functions without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing the \"zipper\" metaphor or other explanation-specific content\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Both DNA strands being synthesized the same way (leading strand is continuous; lagging strand is synthesized in Okazaki fragments)\n   - DNA polymerase being able to start synthesis on its own (it needs a primer)\n   - Replication being error-free (proofreading catches most errors but some slip through)\n   - Replication happening randomly along the chromosome (it starts at specific origins)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Sort order works well for replication sequence. Fill blank works for enzyme roles. Multiple choice for understanding why the process works as it does.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",

Scenarios are novel and don't reference any specific text. The matchColumns question connects functions to molecules, which is reasonable (though it borders on recall, the descriptions are functional rather than just naming). The sortOrder is well-constructed. Feedback is consistently strong—explains why correct answers are right and why incorrect ones are wrong with mechanistic reasoning. Factually accurate throughout: correctly distinguishes leading/lagging strands, acknowledges proofreading limitations, and correctly handles the template damage scenario. The language is in Portuguese (with minor accent omissions that don't affect comprehension). Questions are clear and unambiguous. The matchColumns format does lean slightly toward naming enzymes, which the guidelines flag as a BAD PATTERN without application context, but the left column describes functions rather than just asking to name them.

Entretanto: usa explicitamente metáfora de “zíper” no feedback do Q1 (desencorajado). Além disso, o sortOrder está provavelmente em ordem conceitual discutível: coloca ‘unir pedaços’ antes de ‘enzimas revisoras corrigem’, quando a revisão ocorre durante a síntese e antes/de forma acoplada; a própria justificativa também simplifica (“por fim, tudo é conferido”). Isso pode induzir concepção errada de sequência.",

O feedback do sortOrder afirma “trocam eventuais falhas” e sugere “cópia perfeita”, encostando na armadilha de replicação sem erros (mesmo que mencione ‘eventuais’).
