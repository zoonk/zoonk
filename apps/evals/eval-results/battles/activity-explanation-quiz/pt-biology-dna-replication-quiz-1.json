  "expectations": "\nLANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: Questions, options, and feedback must be in Portuguese.\n\nTOPIC-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\n\n1. APPLICATION CHECK:\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Scenarios requiring understanding of WHY replication works as it does (directionality constraints, error correction needs)\n   - GOOD PATTERN: Situations where learners must predict outcomes of replication errors or enzyme malfunctions\n   - BAD PATTERN: Asking to name enzymes or describe their functions without application context\n   - BAD PATTERN: Questions referencing the \"zipper\" metaphor or other explanation-specific content\n\n2. ACCURACY PITFALLS - Penalize if any of these are stated or implied:\n   - Both DNA strands being synthesized the same way (leading strand is continuous; lagging strand is synthesized in Okazaki fragments)\n   - DNA polymerase being able to start synthesis on its own (it needs a primer)\n   - Replication being error-free (proofreading catches most errors but some slip through)\n   - Replication happening randomly along the chromosome (it starts at specific origins)\n\n3. FORMAT FIT: Sort order works well for replication sequence. Fill blank works for enzyme roles. Multiple choice for understanding why the process works as it does.\n\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n\n1. UNDERSTANDING OVER MEMORIZATION: Questions must test conceptual understanding, not recall. A learner who understood the concept but never read this specific explanation should be able to answer correctly. Penalize questions that:\n   - Use phrases like \"according to the text,\" \"as described,\" or \"the explanation said\"\n   - Reference specific metaphors, analogies, or examples from the explanation steps\n   - Ask \"what is X?\" instead of \"what would happen if...\" or \"which scenario shows...\"\n\n2. APPLICATION TO NOVEL SCENARIOS: Questions should present concepts in new contexts the learner hasn't seen. The scenario in the question should be different from any examples in the explanation steps. Penalize questions that:\n   - Reuse scenarios from the explanation\n   - Ask about facts that could only be known by reading this specific text\n   - Test vocabulary definitions rather than concept application\n\n3. FORMAT APPROPRIATENESS: Evaluate whether the chosen format genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   ANTI-PATTERN - \"Forced variety\": Using different formats just for variety is a serious flaw. Multiple well-crafted questions of the same format are better than poorly-suited formats used for variety's sake. Do NOT penalize for using multiple choice repeatedly if it tests the concepts well.\n\n   Format guidance:\n   - Multiple choice: Often the BEST choice, not just a \"default.\" It excels at testing whether learners can apply concepts to novel scenarios. Use it freely.\n   - Match columns: Best when the concept involves connecting observations to principles (symptoms to causes, effects to mechanisms).\n   - Sort order: ONLY when the concept IS about sequence — when order matters conceptually (biological processes, compilation phases).\n   - Fill blank: Best for completing relationships or processes where the blank tests conceptual understanding.\n   - Select image: ONLY when visual recognition genuinely tests understanding.\n\n   PENALIZE when:\n   - Formats are used for variety rather than fit\n   - A different format would clearly test the concept better\n\n   Do NOT penalize when:\n   - Multiple choice is used repeatedly across several questions\n   - Some available formats are not used at all\n   - The quiz sticks to one or two well-suited formats\n\n4. FEEDBACK QUALITY: Feedback must explain reasoning, not just state correct/incorrect. Good feedback:\n   - For correct answers: Explains WHY it's right plus an additional insight\n   - For incorrect answers: Explains WHY it's wrong AND why the correct answer is right\n   Penalize feedback that only says \"Correct!\" or \"That's wrong.\"\n\n5. FACTUAL ACCURACY: All questions and answers must be scientifically/technically correct. Penalize:\n   - Incorrect facts presented as correct answers\n   - Correct facts marked as incorrect\n   - Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions\n\n6. QUESTION CLARITY: Questions must be unambiguous with a conversational tone. Penalize:\n   - Academic or formal phrasing\n   - Ambiguous scenarios where multiple answers could be valid\n   - Trick questions designed to confuse rather than test understanding\n\n7. APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: Questions should challenge understanding without being unfair. Penalize:\n   - Trivially easy questions anyone could guess\n   - Questions requiring knowledge beyond the lesson scope\n   - Trick questions that test careful reading rather than comprehension\n\nANTI-CHECKLIST GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):\n- Do NOT penalize for missing specific question formats you might expect\n- Do NOT require a specific number of questions - quality matters more than quantity\n- Do NOT check against an imagined \"complete\" quiz you think should exist\n- Do NOT penalize for covering some concepts more than others if coverage is reasonable\n- Do NOT expect questions to follow any particular order or progression\n- ONLY penalize for: memorization-based questions, factual errors, poor feedback quality, unclear wording, or inappropriate format choices\n- Different valid quiz designs exist - assess the quality of what IS provided\n\n    ",
