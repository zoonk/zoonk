While very closely related to Frontend Development, these terms can be interpreted as having a narrower scope, focusing more on the visual presentation layer (HTML, CSS) rather than the full client-side logic and application architecture (JavaScript frameworks, state management) that is typically encompassed by \"Frontend Development\". According to the instructions, narrower topics that could plausibly be shipped as a separate course should be excluded. A \"UI Development\" course could be distinct from a more comprehensive \"Frontend Development\" course. Therefore, including these terms violates the strict rule of providing titles with the \"exact same meaning\".",
