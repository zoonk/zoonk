While the generated chapter list is excellent as a 'general introduction to law', it almost completely omits chapters on the main branches of substantive law (e.g., Civil Law, Criminal Law, Labor Law, Administrative Law). A learner completing this course would know about the legal system and legal practice, but would not know the actual substance of the law required for any entry-level legal position, such as a paralegal. This is a major omission that makes the course fall short of its stated 'job-ready' goal.",

Without these, the course is purely theoretical and procedural, lacking the practical legal knowledge needed for employment.",
