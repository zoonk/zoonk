# Zoonk Evals

This is an internal app for running evals on LLMs. It is not intended for public use.

## Running the App

From the root directory of the repository, run:

```bash
pnpm evals
```

This will build the evals app and start the server. You can then access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

From there, you'll have a UI to run evals for different models and tasks.
