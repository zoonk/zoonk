# Zoonk Auth

This package contains our authentication configuration and utilities. We're using [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for authentication.

LLMS can find their entire docs in their [llms.txt](https://www.better-auth.com/llms.txt) file or connecting to their [MCP server](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction#mcp).
