# Zoonk Utils

This package contains utility and helper functions that can be used across our applications.

## Usage

```ts
import { normalizeString } from "zoonk/utils/string";
```

## Guidelines

- Group related utilities into separate files (e.g., `string.ts`, `date.ts`, `array.ts`).
- Give meaningful names to utility functions that clearly describe their purpose.
- Write unit tests for each utility function to ensure reliability.
