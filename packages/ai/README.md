# Zoonk AI

This package contains functions for AI-powered features in Zoonk. We're using the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) for AI generation. Only add other dependencies when the AI SDK doesn't support the required functionality.

## Usage

```tsx
import { generateCourseSuggestions } from "zoonk/ai/course-suggestions/generate";
```
