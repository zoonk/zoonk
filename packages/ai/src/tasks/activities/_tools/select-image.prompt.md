Create an image selection question. Use SPARINGLY.

Use when: Visual recognition genuinely tests understanding better than text-based formats - the concept IS visual or real-world application involves visual identification.

Requirements:

- Only use when visual selection is THE BEST way to test this concept
- 2-4 image options with generation prompts (describe content, not style)
- Most concepts are better tested with other formats
