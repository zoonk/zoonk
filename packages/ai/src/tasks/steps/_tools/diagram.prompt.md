Create a diagram visual showing relationships between concepts.

Use when: The step explains how components connect, system architecture, process flows, hierarchies, or any content where relationships between entities matter.

Requirements:

- Nodes represent concepts, components, or entities (max 30 chars each)
- Edges show connections with optional labels
- Use unique, descriptive IDs for nodes
- Do NOT include x/y positions - the frontend will compute layout
- Keep diagrams focused: prefer 3-7 nodes for clarity
