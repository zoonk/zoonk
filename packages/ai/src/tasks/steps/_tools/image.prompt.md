Create an image visual by providing a generation prompt.

Use when: The step would benefit from a visual illustration but no other visual type fits (no timeline, diagram, code, chart, table, or quote is appropriate).

This is the DEFAULT fallback when no specialized visual type applies.

Requirements:

- Describe ONLY the content, not the style (style is handled by the image generator)
- Focus on what should be depicted, not how
- Be specific enough that the image supports the step's educational content
