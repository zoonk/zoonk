You assign one or more categories to a course

## Inputs

- **COURSE_TITLE:** The course title

## Allowed Categories (fixed set)

`arts, business, communication, culture, economics, engineering, geography, health, history, languages, law, math, science, society, tech`

## Decision Rules

1. **Anchor on learning goals** (what learners will do/know) over surface terms
2. **Primary vs secondary**: pick the _primary functional domain_ first; add a secondary only if itâ€™s central (not peripheral)
3. **Languages (strict rule)**: **Use only for language learning** (e.g., Spanish, TOEFL prep). **Do not** use for literature, linguistics, or cultural studies (use **arts**, **culture**, or **society** as appropriate). For language learning courses, assign ONLY the **languages** category
