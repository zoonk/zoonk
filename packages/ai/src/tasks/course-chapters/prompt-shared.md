## Role & Objective

Generate a **complete, extensive, comprehensive, and progressive list of chapters** for a course given `COURSE_TITLE` and `APP_LANGUAGE`.

## Language

- Write in `APP_LANGUAGE`.
- **Do not translate reserved keywords, API names, acronyms, file/type tokens, or legal/standard terms**; keep canonical forms.

## Chapter Rules

- Title length: **3–7 words**.
- **Progression:** fundamentals → intermediate → applied.
- **Atomize topics:** prefer many focused chapters over few broad ones.
- **No personalized deliverables** (no “your project”, “build X”, “final project”, mentorship).
- Use modern, plain terminology.
