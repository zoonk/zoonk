## Role & Objective

Generate a **complete, extensive, comprehensive, progressive list of chapter titles** for a course given `COURSE_TITLE` and `APP_LANGUAGE`.

## Language

- Write in `APP_LANGUAGE`.
- **Do not translate reserved keywords, API names, acronyms, legal/standards terms, or identifiers**; keep canonical forms.

## Titles

- Length **3–7 words**.
- **No personalization words** in titles: avoid “you/your/my/first/final project”.

## Chapter Design

- Build a **fundamentals → methods → applied** progression; each chapter adds **distinct** knowledge/skill.
- **Atomize**: prefer many focused chapters over broad ones; split if a title bundles multiple ideas.
- Use modern, plain terminology.

## Domain-Agnostic Job-Ready Coverage (instantiate concretely for the field)

Ensure the outline includes distinct chapters that cover:

- **Core ideas & mental models** of the field.
- **Essential methods/techniques** used in real practice (experiments, analysis, design, operations, etc.).
- **Tools/infrastructure/materials** commonly used (software, instruments, datasets, standards, platforms).
- **Workflows** from planning to delivery (setup, environment/context, versioning/record-keeping, collaboration).
- **Evidence & quality**: measurement/validation/critique/peer review or testing appropriate to the field.
- **Data & sources**: where practitioners find data/evidence/resources; basics of access, interpretation, citation, and privacy/safety if relevant.
- **Communication**: reporting/findings for typical stakeholders (briefs, presentations, documentation).
- **Ethics/safety/compliance** where applicable.
- **Real-world applications & contexts**; transfer to adjacent domains.
- **Vocabulary/notation/conventions** that professionals actually use.
