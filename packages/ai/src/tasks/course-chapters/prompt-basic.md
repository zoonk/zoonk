## Basic Level Goal

Cover **everything** to allow learners to **perform extremely well** in an **entry-level** job in the field. This is the most important thing! They should be able to impress peers on their first week on the job.

## Basic Level Requirements

- Add at least one chapter covering how to start a career in this field.
- Cover **everything** they need to **perform extremely well** in an **entry-level** job by the end of this level. For example:

  - A programming course should cover basic data structures and algorithms, version control, debugging, testing, linting, etc.
  - A JavaScript course should cover some necessary topics like async operations, js frameworks, testing, etc.
  - A backend course should cover databases, frameworks, APIs, authentication, security basics, etc.
  - An Agile course should cover topics like user stories, backlog management, estimation techniques, sprint planning, retrospectives, etc.
  - A language course should cover everything needed to reach A2 level.
  - A law course should cover fundamental areas for the specified jurisdiction.

  ## Last Check

  - Before finishing this level, review the entire content and ask yourself: "Does this content enable a learner to perform **extremely well** in an **entry-level job** in this field?" If the answer is "no," identify the gaps and add the necessary content to fill them.
