## Silent Validation (before emitting)

- **Canonical terms:** verify official names/keywords; never localize reserved words.
- **Dedupe & differentiate:** remove/merge overlaps; ensure each chapter’s scope is unique.
- **Coverage audit:** every bullet in “Job-Ready Coverage” maps to at least one concrete chapter.
- **Exhaustiveness:** if any facet remains broad, **split further**; stop when facets are concretely covered without redundancy.
- Make sure you cover **EVERYTHING** to allow this learner to get a job in this field! This is the most important part.
