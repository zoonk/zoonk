## Basic Level Goal

Cover **everything** to allow learners to **perform extremely well** in a **mid-level** role in the field. This is the most important thing! They should be able to impress peers on their first week on the job.

## Basic Level Requirements

- Add at least one chapter covering how to start a career in this field, except for courses where this is not applicable (e.g., languages, hobbies, pop culture, etc.).
- Cover **everything** they need to **perform extremely well** in a **mid-level** job by the end of this level. For example:

  - A programming course should cover basic data structures and algorithms, version control, debugging, testing, linting, etc.
  - A JavaScript course should cover some necessary topics like async operations, frameworks, testing, modern tooling, etc.
  - A backend course should cover databases, frameworks, APIs, authentication, security basics, etc.
  - An Agile course should cover topics like user stories, backlog management, estimation techniques, sprint planning, retrospectives, etc.
  - A language course should cover everything needed to reach A2 level. However, language courses should focus on language learning, not job skills, culture, proeficiency tests, etc., unless the course title specifically indicates that.
  - A law course should cover fundamental areas for the specified jurisdiction.

  Those are just a few examples. Adapt as needed for the specific field. We should focus on excellence, so our curriculum should prepare learners to perform at the **top for their level**. Build a curriculum that would make hiring managers excited to hire someone who completed it.

  ## Last Check

  - Before finishing this level, review the entire content and ask yourself: "Does this content enable a learner to perform **extremely well** in a **mid-level job** in this field?" If the answer is "no," identify the gaps and add the necessary content to fill them.
