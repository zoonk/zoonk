## About this app

Zoonk is a learning app that uses AI to create courses with short, interactive exercises that show how things work in real life.

---

## Principles

- Always prefer the **simplest solution**. If something feels complex, refactor
- Favor **clarity and minimalism** in both code and UI
- Default to **Phoenix/LiveView** solutions. Use JavaScript only via `phx-hook` and only when unavoidable
- Follow design inspirations from **Apple, Linear, Vercel**
- Code must be **modular**, **tested**, and follow **SOLID** and **DRY** principles
- Avoid nested conditionals and complex logic. Prefer short and composable functions, making good use of pipes, pattern matching, and guards
- Prefer `:if` on elements instead of conditional blocks. E.g., <ul :if={@items}> instead of <%= if @items do %>
- Use `@impl ModuleName`, not `@impl true`
- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies
- Before submitting code, make sure to review your approach and ask yourself:
  - Is this the simplest and most readable solution?
  - Is it clear and easy to understand?
  - Does it follow the principles outlined in this guide?
  - Is it the most performant solution?
- If you answer "no" to any of these questions, consider refactoring or simplifying your code before submitting

## Project Structure

### Schemas

- Use context-prefixed names: `Zoonk.Accounts.User`
- Include `@moduledoc` with a field table for SCHEMA modules only:
  ```
  Field Name | Type | Description
  ```
- Use `List`, not `Array` when defining a type in docs
- Default `array` fields to `[]`
- Add `timestamps(type: :utc_datetime_usec)`
- Generate migrations along with schema changes using `mix ecto.gen.migration`

### Controllers

- Located in `lib/zoonk_web/controllers/`
- Use `use ZoonkWeb, :controller`
- Match file/module names
- Add `@moduledoc` and `@doc` for each action

### LiveView Pages

- Located in `lib/zoonk_web/live/`
- Add `@moduledoc false`
- Place `render` at the top
- Use `use ZoonkWeb, :live_view`
- Use socket's `assign/3` only for dynamic data. For static data, define a function instead
- **Avoid LiveComponent's** unless you have a strong, specific need for them
- Remember anytime you use `phx-hook="MyHook"` and that js hook manages its own DOM, you **must** also set the `phx-update="ignore"` attribute
- **Always** use LiveView streams for collections for assigning regular lists to avoid memory ballooning and runtime termination with the following operations:
  - basic append of N items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])`
  - resetting stream with new items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], reset: true)` (e.g. for filtering items)
  - prepend to stream - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], at: -1)`
  - deleting items - `stream_delete(socket, :messages, msg)`
- When using the `stream/3` interfaces in the LiveView, the LiveView template must 1) always set `phx-update="stream"` on the parent element, with a DOM id on the parent element like `id="messages"` and 2) consume the `@streams.stream_name` collection and use the id as the DOM id for each child
- LiveView streams are _not_ enumerable, so you cannot use `Enum.filter/2` or `Enum.reject/2` on them. Instead, if you want to filter, prune, or refresh a list of items on the UI, you **must refetch the data and re-stream the entire stream collection, passing reset: true**
- LiveView streams _do not support counting or empty states_. If you need to display a count, you must track it using a separate assign. For empty states, you can use Tailwind classes like `<div class="hidden only:block">No tasks yet</div>`

### Components

- Shared components go in `lib/zoonk_web/components/`
- Import via `html_helpers` in `zoonk_web.ex`
- Use `Phoenix.Component.attr/3`
- Add `@moduledoc` and `@doc` with usage examples
- Add previews in `lib/zoonk_dev/ui_preview/`, register routes, and update `ui_preview_layout.ex`
- Use `<.text>` for all textual content
- Render slots via `{render_slot(@inner_block)}`
- Pass styling through `class=` props, not wrappers
- Don't write tests for UI/functional components
- Keep CSS in the component file, not in `globals.css` (we only add utilities there for reusable/shared styles)

---

## UI and Design Rules

### CSS and Tailwind

- Use **Tailwind v4**
- Avoid default colors — use tokens like `bg-zk-surface`
- Use `zk-` prefix for custom utilities
- Use `size-4` instead of `w-4 h-4`
- Only create custom utilities when we're often using the same styles
- Don't use `space-y-*` or `space-x-*` classes, instead use `gap-*`

### Icons

- Use Tabler icons: `<.icon name="tabler-icon-name" />`

### Accessibility and Responsiveness

- Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use Tailwind breakpoints: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
- Extend `globals.css`, don’t create new CSS files
- Keep animations minimal and non-distracting
- Prefer CSS/Tailwind for animations over JavaScript

---

## Routing and Text

- Use **Verified Routes** (`~p"/path"`), never use `Routes.page_path/2`
- Use **Gettext** for all strings
  - Do not hardcode text
  - Do not generate new translation files
  - Do not run `mix gettext.extract` (this will be done later)

---

## Documentation Standards

- Be clear, concise, objective
- Avoid vague terms like “secure” or “best practice”
- Use `@moduledoc` for modules
- Use `@doc` for functions, with examples
- Don’t prefix examples with `elixir`
- Combine multiple `on_mount` docs into one `@doc`

---

## Testing Guidelines

- Test file: same name as module + `_test`
- Use:
  - `Zoonk.DataCase` for data
  - `ZoonkWeb.ConnCase` for web
- Fixtures in `test/support/fixtures/`
- Avoid `setup` for fixtures; call fixtures directly on each test
- Use `PhoenixTest` library - see [docs](./.github/copilot/llm_docs/phoenix_test.md)
- Use `Phoenix.Flash.get/2` (not `get_flash/2`)
- Don’t expose private functions for testing
- Run tests with `mix test`, not VSCode debugger
- Run `mix format` before committing
- Run `mix ci` after formatting to ensure code quality checks pass

---

## Elixir Usage

### Pattern Matching

- Use function heads and guards over `if`, `case`, `cond`
- Lists and enumerables cannot be indexed with brackets. Use pattern matching or Enum functions

### Error Handling

- Use `{:ok, result}` and `{:error, reason}`
- Avoid raising for flow control
- Use `with` for chaining

### Data and Function Design

- Prefer `Stream` over `Enum` on large collections
- Don’t use `String.to_atom/1` on user input
- Prefer pattern matching, not indexing lists
- Name unused variables as `_name`, not `_`
- Use structs over maps for known shapes
- Prefer keyword lists for options
- Use descriptive function names
- Use `Oban` for background jobs
- Use **pipe-based query syntax** for clarity and composability
- Don't need to write `@spec` for functions but use structs in function signatures
- Elixir has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

### Ecto

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Fields which are set programatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct

### Mix

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason

---

## OTP Usage

### GenServer

- Keep state serializable
- Use `handle_continue/2` after init
- Cleanup in `terminate/2`
- Use `GenServer.call/3` with backpressure
- Use `GenServer.cast/2` for fire-and-forget

### Fault Tolerance

- Use supervisors with limits: `:max_restarts`, `:max_seconds`

### Tasks

- Use `Task.Supervisor`
- Use `Task.yield/2` or `Task.shutdown/2` for failures
- Use `Task.async_stream/3` with timeouts and backpressure
