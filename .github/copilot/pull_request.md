# Pull Request description instructions

- Keep the title short and descriptive.
- Add a prefix to the title similar to how you would in a commit message - in general, follow commit message conventions for PR titles.
- Analyze all code changes and write a summary of what they do and what's the reason for them.
- If necessary, add bullet points to explain the changes in detail.
- If the pull request is related to an issue, add a reference to it.
- Think of the big picture and how the changes fit into the overall project when writing a title and description. For example, what's the most important thing to know about this pull request? Small changes to components in a big refactor or new feature are not as important as the refactor or new feature itself.
