# Pull Request description instructions

- Keep the title short and descriptive.
- Titles should reflect the main purpose of the PR, not incidental changes. For example, use Search: Improve UX instead of Components: Add spinner, even if a spinner was added.
- Add a prefix to the title similar to how you would in a commit message - in general, follow commit message conventions for PR titles.
- Focus on the main goal of the pull request. If there are small unrelated changes (e.g. minor UI tweaks or new components), don’t make them the title unless they are the core purpose of the PR.
- If necessary, add bullet points to explain the changes in detail.
- If the pull request is related to an issue, add a reference to it.
- Think of the big picture and how the changes fit into the overall project when writing a title and description. For example, what's the most important thing to know about this pull request? Small changes to components in a big refactor or new feature are not as important as the refactor or new feature itself.

Always generate both:
• Title: One concise line summarizing the main purpose of the PR.
• Description: A few sentences explaining:
• What was changed and why
• Any relevant context (e.g. fixes a bug, improves UX, prepares for future feature)
• Add the issue number, for example, Fixes #1234 or Closes #1234
