defmodule Zoonk.Orgs.Org do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines the `Org` schema.

  Every data on Zoonk is related to an organization.
  An organization can be a business, a creator, or a school.

  All organizations have a subdomain that can be used
  for their white-label page, e.g. `https://<subdomain>.zoonk.io`.

  Some orgs can also have a custom domain, e.g. `https://<custom_domain>`.
  This is useful for schools and businesses that want to
  use their own domain for their white-label page.
