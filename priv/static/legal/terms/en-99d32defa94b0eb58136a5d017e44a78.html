        <p>Effective date: 02/27/25</p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Zoonk! These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern
            your use of Zoonk&apos;s websites and services. By accessing or
            using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Generated Content</h2>
          <p>
            Users and artificial intelligence agents can create a variety of
            interactive courses on our platforms. You are responsible for
            ensuring the accuracy and appropriateness of the content you create
            or use. Zoonk does not endorse or assume liability for generated
            content, either by other users or by artificial intelligence. Users
            acknowledge that AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies or
            biases. Users remain fully responsible for reviewing and verifying
            any AI-generated content before use or distribution. Zoonk does not
            guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or legality of AI-generated
            content and reserves the right to modify or remove it at its
            discretion. Users may report inappropriate AI-generated content, and
            Zoonk reserves the right to review, remove, or modify such content
            at its discretion.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Transactions</h2>
          <p>
            Online transactions are processed through Stripe. Payments made
            through third-party services (e.g., Stripe, Apple, Google, or other
            payment processors) are subject to their respective terms and
            conditions. Zoonk is not responsible for errors, service
            disruptions, or disputes arising from these third-party services.
            Users acknowledge that refunds for purchases made through these
            services must be handled directly with the respective platform.
            Zoonk reserves the right to remove user accounts for frequently
            contesting credit card charges since those represent a high risk for
            us because we can lose our Stripe account when that happens. Users
            should request refunds within 30 days of purchase. Refunds will be
            processed to the original payment method unless stated otherwise.
            Subscription cancellations must be made at least 24 hours before the
            next billing cycle to avoid being charged for the next period.
            Failure to cancel on time will result in continued charges, and
            refunds will not be issued for past billing cycles. If a purchase
            was made through a third-party platform (such as the App Store or
            Google Play), users must request refunds directly from that
            platform, following their respective policies. Fraudulent refund
            claims or abuse of the refund policy may result in account
            termination. For subscription-based services, refunds are only
            available for charges within the last billing cycle, and prorated
            refunds are not provided. Frequent chargebacks may result in account
            suspension or termination.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>4. User Conduct and Moderation</h2>
          <p>
            We may remove content that spreads misinformation, violates our code
            of conduct, or is deemed harmful or misleading. Zoonk reserves the
            right to take action, including content removal, account suspension,
            or termination. Users may appeal content removal or account
            suspensions by contacting hello@zoonk.com. Appeals will be reviewed
            on a case-by-case basis, but Zoonk’s decision is final.
          </p>

          <p>
            Zoonk is committed to maintaining a respectful and safe environment
            for all users. The following types of content are not allowed on our
            platforms:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Discriminatory Content: Any content that is racist, homophobic,
              xenophobic, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.
            </li>

            <li>
              Religious Content: We prohibit the posting of religious content to
              maintain a neutral and inclusive environment. We prohibit
              religious and political content unless it is presented in an
              academic, historical, or educational context. For example,
              discussions on religious influences in history or political
              systems in governance courses are allowed. However, proselytizing,
              advocacy, or politically charged content is not permitted.
            </li>

            <li>
              Political Content: Political content is not permitted, as it can
              lead to divisive discussions.
            </li>

            <li>
              Inappropriate Language and Imagery: The use of sexualized
              language, imagery, or any form of sexual attention or advances is
              strictly forbidden.
            </li>

            <li>
              Trolling and Harassment: Insulting, derogatory comments, trolling,
              personal attacks, and political attacks are not tolerated.
            </li>

            <li>Spam and Scams: Spam, phishing, and scams are not allowed.</li>

            <li>
              Copyrighted Content: Content protected by copyright laws is also
              prohibited. If you believe your content has been copied in a way
              that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact us at
              hello@zoonk.com.
            </li>

            <li>
              Violent Content: Content that promotes violence or depicts any
              explicit imagery of violence is not allowed.
            </li>

            <li>
              Drugs and Alcohol: Content that promotes or depicts the use of
              legal or illegal drugs or alcohol is not allowed.
            </li>

            <li>
              Any content that violates local laws or promotes illegal activity
              is also prohibited.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Violations of these guidelines may result in content removal and
            potentially lead to account termination for repeated offenses. Zoonk
            reserves the right to enforce these rules at its discretion to
            ensure a safe and respectful user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their
            login credentials. Any activity under a user’s account is their
            responsibility. Users should notify Zoonk of unauthorized access
            immediately.

          <h2>5. Age Restrictions</h2>
          <p>Users must be 13 years or older to use Zoonk&apos;s services.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Copyright and Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>You must not share content that violates copyright laws.</p>

          <p>
            Different Zoonk platforms have different terms regarding content
            ownership.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Zoonk Teams</strong>: A paid white-label solution for
              organizations. Organizations retain full ownership of their
              content. Zoonk does not use, modify, or distribute content created
              within Zoonk Teams without explicit authorization.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Zoonk Schools</strong>: A paid white-label solution for
              educational institutions. The same terms as Zoonk Teams
              apply—schools own their content, and Zoonk does not use or modify
              it without permission.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Zoonk Store</strong>: A platform where creators can sell
              courses and operate a white-label school. Zoonk does not claim
              ownership of content created and sold in Zoonk Store. However, a
              commission fee applies to sales made through the platform.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Zoonk.com:</strong> The main Zoonk platform offering
              subscriptions to individual users. This platform also includes
              free social features that allow users to contribute updates and
              improvements to courses. Any content contributed to Zoonk.com
              grants Zoonk a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to
              use, modify, distribute, or sell the content within its platform
              and affiliated services, including - but not limited to - Zoonk
              Teams, Zoonk Schools, and Zoonk Store. Zoonk does not claim
              ownership of user-generated content, but users acknowledge that
              their contributions may be integrated into the platform without
              compensation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Report any copyright violations to hello@zoonk.com. Plagiarism may
            result in content removal or account termination. Users are
            encouraged to review their content regularly to ensure compliance
            with copyright laws.

          <h2>7. Liability and Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            Zoonk does not endorse or assume liability for generated content,
            either by other users or by artificial intelligence. Users
            acknowledge that our content may contain inaccuracies or biases, and
            they are solely responsible for verifying its accuracy before use.
            Zoonk is not responsible for any direct or indirect damages
            resulting from reliance on educational content, including but not
            limited to financial, medical, or legal consequences. Our content
            cannot be used for fraudulent or misleading purposes. Zoonk reserves
            the right to remove or restrict any content at its discretion. Zoonk
            is not liable for any damages resulting from the use of such
            content. Users acknowledge that they use Zoonk’s services at their
            own risk and should exercise critical judgment when consuming or
            creating content. Users should also understand that Zoonk's
            educational materials should not replace professional advice or
            judgment. If you have any questions about the content or its
            applicability, please seek guidance from a qualified professional.
          </p>

          <h3>7.1. Warranty</h3>

          <p>
            Zoonk’s services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without
            warranties of any kind, express or implied. Zoonk disclaims all
            warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
            for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

          <h2>8. Acceptance of Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>By using our services, you agree to our Privacy Policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Pricing and Terms Changes</h2>
          <p>
            Zoonk reserves the right to change pricing policies with a 30-day
            notice, which may be provided via email, platform notifications, or
            updates to these Terms. In case of pricing errors or
            misrepresentations, Zoonk may correct the error and refuse service
            at the incorrect price. We may also amend these Terms at any time,
            with notice provided to users. Continued use of Zoonk after changes
            take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. Lifetime
            access is valid for the plans and features available at the time of
            purchase. We may add new plans that are not available for lifetime
            access. Plus, lifetime access has limited spots (5,000 spots for the
            Basic Plan and 1,000 spots for the Plus Plan) - once they are sold
            out, we will not offer it again. Lifetime access is only available
            to individual users, not to teams or content creators. If Zoonk
            ceases operations, lifetime access will be voided. We will, however,
            provide a 30-day notice before ceasing operations and allow users to
            download their content. After 30 days of ceasing operations, all
            user content will be deleted. Users acknowledge that any data not
            backed up or downloaded before this period may be irretrievably
            lost.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
          <p>
            Legal disputes will be resolved under the laws of Brazil,
            specifically in Brasília. If a provision of these Terms is found to
            be unenforceable under a particular jurisdiction’s laws, the
            remaining provisions will still apply to the fullest extent
            permitted. Before initiating legal action, users agree to attempt to
            resolve disputes through arbitration or mediation. For users outside
            Brazil, local consumer protection laws may apply, but Zoonk retains
            discretion on dispute resolution.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>11. Service Availability & Modifications</h2>
          <p>
            Zoonk does not guarantee uninterrupted access to its services. We
            may modify, discontinue, or limit certain features at any time
            without prior notice. Users acknowledge that downtime or service
            disruptions may occur and waive any claims against Zoonk related to
            such interruptions. Zoonk integrates with third-party services (such
            as payment processors, authentication providers, and cloud hosting).
            While we take reasonable measures to ensure service continuity, we
            are not liable for failures, errors, or disruptions caused by
            third-party providers. In cases of extended downtime due to
            third-party failures, Zoonk will make reasonable efforts to restore
            functionality but does not guarantee uninterrupted access. While
            Zoonk takes reasonable measures to ensure uptime and availability,
            we are not responsible for losses due to technical failures,
            maintenance, or unforeseen disruptions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            Users agree to indemnify and hold Zoonk, its affiliates, officers,
            employees, and agents harmless from any claims, damages,
            liabilities, or legal fees arising from their use of our services,
            including but not limited to copyright infringement, misuse of
            AI-generated content, and violations of these Terms. Users must
            promptly notify Zoonk of any such claims. This includes claims
            related to copyright infringement, misuse of AI-generated content,
            and violations of these Terms. Users agree to cooperate with Zoonk
            in the defense of any such claims and may not settle any claim
            without Zoonk's prior written consent.

        <section>
          <h2>14. Relationship with Content Creators</h2>
          <p>
            Content creators have full control over their content but must
            comply with our code of conduct and terms of use. Zoonk does not
            claim ownership of creator content but reserves the right to
            display, distribute, or modify content created on the main platform
            as necessary for functionality. For content created through Zoonk’s
            white-label solution, creators and organizations retain full
            ownership, and Zoonk will not use or modify such content without
            explicit authorization. For further details, refer to Section 6 on
            Copyright and Intellectual Property.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>15. Discretionary Discounts</h2>
          <p>
            Discounts are offered at Zoonk’s discretion and are not indicative
            of future pricing or discounts for other users. Discounts are
            non-transferable and cannot be retroactively applied to past
            purchases. Users should also be aware that certain conditions may
            apply to the availability of discounts, and Zoonk reserves the right
            to modify or terminate discount offerings at any time.

        <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>

        <p>
          These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any referenced
          documents, constitute the entire agreement between you and Zoonk
          regarding the services. They supersede all prior agreements,
          understandings, or communications.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>18. Severability</h2>

        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, that
          provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary, and the
          remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
