          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to all websites managed by{" "}
            <em>Zoonk Tecnologia e Educação Ltda.</em>. We are committed to
            protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly. Our
            processing of personal data is based on one or more of the following
            legal bases:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Contract necessity (e.g., processing payments, providing requested
              services).
            </li>
            <li>
              Legal obligations (e.g., compliance with tax or law enforcement
              requests).
            </li>
            <li>
              Legitimate business interests (e.g., analytics for service
              improvements, fraud prevention), unless these interests are
              overridden by your rights.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <p>We may collect the following information when you signs up:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full name</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Email address</li>

          <p>
            Additionally, we collect data related to your website interactions,
            preferred language, and IP address for security purposes. We may
            also track your usage—such as clicks, navigation patterns, and time
            spent on pages—using analytics tools and we may use cookies. These
            cookies and tracking technologies help improve your experience and
            optimize our platform. Users can manage their cookie preferences in
            their browser settings.

          <h2>3. Use of Collected Data</h2>
          <p>We process your data for the following purposes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Personalizing course recommendations</li>
            <li>Sending essential notifications (e.g., account updates)</li>
            <li>
              Sending marketing communications (only with explicit consent)

          </ul>

          <p>
            We do not sell your data. However, we share necessary information
            with third-party service providers to operate our platform
            efficiently. These third parties act as data processors and are
            contractually bound to handle your data securely and solely for the
            purposes specified. Some services, such as AI-based features, may
            process your data independently as data controllers. Third-party AI
            services may receive user input for processing, but we do not share
            personally identifiable data with them. See Section 8 for details.

              Data is processed in the United States and Brazil. Some personal

              By using our services, you acknowledge that your data may be
              transferred outside your country, subject to legal safeguards. We
              may also store anonymized data for research and development. We
              may also share aggregated data for statistical analysis and
              reporting purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of a data breach affecting personal data, we will notify
              affected users via email or an in-app notification as soon as
              possible. If required by law, we will also notify relevant
              authorities within the legally mandated timeframe. We will also
              provide updates on the status of any breach and the steps taken to
              mitigate potential harm.

            </li>
            <li>
              If an account is inactive for 2 years, we may delete it after
              prior notice. However, non-personal content you contributed may
              remain.
            </li>
