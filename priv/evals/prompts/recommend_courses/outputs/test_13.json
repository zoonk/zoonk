Titles may include 1–3 words if that’s part of the standard name of the field (e.g. \"Data Science\", \"UI Design\", \"Mechanical Engineering\"). Avoid vague or invented titles. Prefer canonical ones.\n- Never include qualifiers like \"Basics\", \"Foundations\", \"Intro\", \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\", \"Essentials\", \"101\", etc.\n- Never include \"and\", \"or\", or slashes (/) in the title.\n- Never group topics into one title. Always split them.\n- Titles should be canonical academic or professional fields (e.g. \"Physics\", \"Law\", \"Art\", \"Engineering\", \"Neuroscience\").\n- If the user input is vague (e.g. “I want to code”), map it to broader established fields (e.g. “Computer Science”, “Web Development”, “Mobile Development”).\n- Each course must also include an `english_title` field that is a string representing the `title` in English.\n\nExamples of valid course titles:\n- Computer Science\n- Data Science\n- UI Design\n- UX Design\n- Mechanical Engineering\n- Electrical Engineering\n- Cognitive Psychology\n- Artificial Intelligence\n\nIf the user input is already a valid or common course name (e.g. \"Educação Financeira\", \"Digital Transformation\", \"Leadership\"), include it as one of the suggestions — ideally the first.\nDo not replace it with more academic fields unless the original term is too vague or nonstandard.\nIf the input closely resembles a good course title, include a suggestion using the same or very similar title.\n\nEach course must also include a 1-sentence description that:\n- Clearly explains what the course covers.\n- Highlights why it may be useful or relevant to the user.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: I want to build mobile apps\nOutput:\n- Mobile Development – Learn how to create apps for iOS and Android using tools like Swift, Kotlin, and Flutter.\n- UI Design – Explore how to design intuitive and responsive mobile interfaces.\n- Computer Science – Understand the foundational concepts behind software and app development.\n\nInput: Quero aprender a desenhar personagens\nOutput:\n- Ilustração Digital – Aprenda a desenhar personagens usando ferramentas como o Procreate e o Photoshop.\n- Design de Personagens – Descubra como criar personagens únicos, com estilo e personalidade.\n- Anatomia Artística – Entenda proporções e movimento para criar figuras humanas mais realistas.\n\nEach course must also have an `icon` field with a tabler icon to illustrate this course. For example:\n- Computer Science – icon: \"tabler-code\"\n- Data Science – icon: \"tabler-chart-pie\"\n- UI Design – icon: \"tabler-palette\"\n\nAlways add the `tabler-` prefix to the icon name.\n",
