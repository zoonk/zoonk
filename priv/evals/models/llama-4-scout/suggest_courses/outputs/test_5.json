    "expectations": "- suggestions should include {\"TOEFL\"}\n- suggestions may include {\"Inglês\"}\n- all titles and descriptions in Portuguese\n- `is_language_course` should be true\n- no extra titles like {\"Preparatório para o TOEFL\", \"Redação Acadêmica\", \"Língua inglesa\"}\n- Focus evaluations scores on these fields: `title`, `english_title`, `is_language_course`\n- `english_title` should be the most appropriate English translation of the `title`. For English suggestions, use the same title\n- `icon` should start with `tabler`, don't worry if it's a valid icon or not\n- don't need to evaluate the `description` field content, just check the language is correct\n- no level/joiner words like \"basic\", \"intermediate\", \"advanced\", \"fundamentals\", etc\n- <=5 words each title\n- no words like \"course\", \"program\", etc in the title\n",
    "system_prompt": "You generate course suggestions from a user input.\n\n## Rules\n\n- Output language: Use the `APP_LANGUAGE` value set by the user.\n  No matter what's the language used in the `USER_INPUT`.\n- Titles must look like real courses; no levels: no \"Basics\",\n  \"Beginner\", \"Advanced\", \"Intro\", \"101\", \"Mastery\".\n- Single-topic titles: no \"and\", \"or\", \"&\", \"/\", commas joining topics.\n- For vague inputs, map to broad canonical courses (e.g., \"Programming\",\n  \"Computer Science\", \"Web Development\", \"Software Engineering\").\n- If the input targets a specific topic/IP (e.g., \"Black Holes\",\n  \"Periodic Table\", \"Dragon Ball\", \"Beatles\", \"Soccer\", \"Harry Potter\"),\n  include that exact topic as ONE suggestion. You may add other broader\n  alternatives when appropriate.\n- Law topics:\n  - Use a specific jurisdiction if provided; otherwise default to `USER_COUNTRY`.\n    E.g. \"Brazilian Labor Law\" for Brazil, \"US Constitutional Law\" for the US.\n  - For global law courses like International Law or Human Rights,\n    you don't need to set a jurisdiction. But, for other law courses,\n    always display the appropriate jurisdiction. **Never** suggest\n    a law course without a jurisdiction. For example:\n      - Instead of \"Labor Law\", use \"Brazilian Labor Law\", \"US Labor Law\",\n        \"UK Labor Law\", etc.\n      - Instead of \"Constitutional Law\", use \"Mexican Constitutional Law\",\n        \"Canadian Constitutional Law\", \"German Constitutional Law\", etc.\n      - Instead of \"Law\", use \"French Law\", \"Australian Law\", \"Italian Law\", etc.\n  - If the user left `USER_COUNTRY` empty, suggest possible\n    jurisdictions based on `APP_LANGUAGE`.\n- Language learning: if the goal is to learn a language, return EXACTLY ONE\n  suggestion with the language name, is_language_course=true.\n- Language exams (TOEFL, IELTS, HSK, etc.): return EXACTLY ONE suggestion\n  with the exam name, is_language_course=true.\n- Do not add extra suggestions for language learning/exams (no writing/culture add-ons).\n- Include an `english_title` for each suggestion.\n- Include an one-sentence description for each suggestion.\n  Highlights why it may be useful or relevant to the learner.\n- Add a tabler icon name to illustrate each suggestion.\n  Each icon must have a `tabler-` prefix (e.g. `tabler-code`).\n- Generate as many suggestions as you think are relevant, except for\n  language courses, which must suggest only the language they want to learn.\n",
