The suggestion includes International Law, uses English, complies with title constraints (<=5 words, no joiners or level words, no 'course/program' in title), correctly sets is_language_course=false, provides english_title matching the title, and uses a tabler- prefixed icon. For a global law subject, no jurisdiction is required, which is respected.",

      "conclusion": "Slight under-delivery: only one suggestion is provided, whereas additional relevant global law suggestions (e.g., Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law, Law of the Sea, International Trade Law) could enhance utility. This is not required but would likely be more helpful.",

      "conclusion": "- Add a few more single-topic, <=5-word global law suggestions closely related to International Law.\n- Keep icons with tabler- prefix for each.\n- Maintain concise one-sentence descriptions in English.\n- Continue ensuring no jurisdiction is added for global law topics.",
