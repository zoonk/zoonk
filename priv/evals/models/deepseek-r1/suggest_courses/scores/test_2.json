All three titles are in Portuguese.\n- Second suggestion violates the single-topic rule by combining topics with a joiner: \"Astronomia e Astrof√≠sica\" (and its english_title \"Astronomy and Astrophysics\"). The instructions forbid \"and/or/&/commas\" in titles.\n- Output-language rule breach: While descriptions are in English, the primary \"title\" fields are not, which conflicts with the specified output language requirement.",
