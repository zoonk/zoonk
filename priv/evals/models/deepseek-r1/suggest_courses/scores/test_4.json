      "conclusion": "Could add a few more highly relevant international law subfields to increase coverage (e.g., International Human Rights Law, International Criminal Law, Law of the Sea, International Trade Law). Optionally consider a broader procedural topic like International Dispute Settlement. Current set is strong but could be richer.",
