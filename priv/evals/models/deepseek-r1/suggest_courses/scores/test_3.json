      "conclusion": "Missing the required suggestion 'Derecho Penal Mexicano' despite the Expectations. With USER_COUNTRY empty and APP_LANGUAGE in Spanish, the system should suggest plausible jurisdictions (e.g., Mexico). Only Spain was provided for criminal law, which fails the explicit expectation. All other core constraints (Spanish titles, <=5 words, no joiners, proper english_title, is_language_course=false, tabler- icons) were met.",

    {
      "kind": "minor_errors",
      "conclusion": "Coverage is narrow: only one jurisdictional criminal law suggestion was provided; including multiple Spanish-language jurisdictions would better satisfy the rule about suggesting possible jurisdictions. The inclusion of 'Derecho Internacional' and 'Derechos Humanos' is allowed as global law courses but is less aligned with the specific user input compared to adding closely related jurisdictional alternatives. Icons appear fine (tabler- prefix), titles comply with constraints, and english_title translations are accurate.",

      "kind": "potential_improvements",
      "conclusion": "- Add 'Derecho Penal Mexicano' (must-have per Expectations).\n- Consider additional Spanish-language jurisdictions for criminal law (e.g., 'Derecho Penal Argentino', 'Derecho Penal Colombiano').\n- Optionally add broader and adjacent Mexican law topics such as 'Derecho Mexicano', 'Derecho Civil Mexicano', 'Derecho Laboral Mexicano'.\n- Keep the global law items only after ensuring the primary jurisdictional mapping to the user's intent is covered.",
