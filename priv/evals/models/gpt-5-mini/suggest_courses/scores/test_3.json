The suggestions comply with language requirements (Spanish), include the required jurisdiction for domestic law topics (Mexico), avoid joiners, keep titles to ≤5 words, include a correct English translation for each title, and set is_language_course=false. No law course without jurisdiction is present; the inclusion of International Criminal Law is acceptable as a global law topic.",

      "conclusion": "Could optionally add broader or adjacent Mexican law suggestions such as \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil Mexicano\" or \"Derecho Laboral Mexicano\" to expand the catalog, though not required. Consider slightly more standard phrasing like \"Delitos Económicos en México\", but current phrasing is acceptable.",
