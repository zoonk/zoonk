The response follows the language requirement (Português), includes only non-language courses, provides appropriate single-topic titles without levels or joiners, respects <=5 words per title, and includes valid english_title translations and tabler- prefixed icons.

      "conclusion": "- Consider slightly refining some translations for maximal clarity, e.g., “Banco de Dados” could be translated as “Database Systems” (though “Databases” is acceptable).\n- Optionally swap a few icons to more semantically aligned ones (e.g., a layout icon for Frontend), though current choices meet the prefix requirement.\n- The list is quite comprehensive; depending on UX, fewer suggestions could reduce choice overload while still covering the canonical areas.",
