All 'is_language_course' flags are false. 'english_title' matches the title. Icons have the 'tabler-' prefix. For law/jurisdiction rules, all suggested courses are global international law domains, which do not require jurisdictions per the instructions.",

Optionally, use 'International Human Rights Law' for added clarity, though 'Human Rights Law' is acceptable as a global course per instructions.",
