      "conclusion": "- The title \"Derecho Internacional de los Derechos Humanos\" exceeds the <=5 words limit (it has 6 words), violating the title length constraint.\n- Coverage could be improved by adding related Mexican-law options (e.g., \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil Mexicano\", \"Derecho Laboral Mexicano\"), though this is optional per expectations.\n- Other constraints (Spanish output, english_title present, is_language_course=false, icons with tabler- prefix) are satisfied.",

      "conclusion": "- Include jurisdiction-specific titles, especially \"Derecho Penal Mexicano\". Also consider Spanish-language jurisdictions when USER_COUNTRY is empty (e.g., México, España, Argentina, Colombia).\n- Keep titles to <=5 words and single-topic. Examples:\n  • Derecho Penal Mexicano (English: Mexican Criminal Law)\n  • Derecho Penal Español (English: Spanish Criminal Law)\n  • Derecho Penal Argentino (English: Argentine Criminal Law)\n  • Derecho Mexicano (English: Mexican Law)\n  • Derecho Civil Mexicano (English: Mexican Civil Law)\n  • Derecho Laboral Mexicano (English: Mexican Labor Law)\n  • For a global option, use a concise title like \"Derecho Internacional Público\" (English: Public International Law).\n- Maintain is_language_course=false and valid tabler- icons; keep one-sentence descriptions.",
