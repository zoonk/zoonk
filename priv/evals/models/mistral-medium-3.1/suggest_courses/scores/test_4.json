All constraints are met: correct language, inclusion of the exact topic 'International Law', titles have no level/joiner words, each title has ≤5 words, single-topic titles, proper english_title mirroring title, is_language_course=false for all, and icons start with 'tabler-'. No jurisdiction omissions apply since all are global law subjects.",

      "conclusion": "Could broaden coverage with additional relevant international law subfields (e.g., International Criminal Law, Law of the Sea, International Trade Law, International Environmental Law, International Arbitration) while keeping titles ≤5 words. This would provide more choice without violating rules.",
