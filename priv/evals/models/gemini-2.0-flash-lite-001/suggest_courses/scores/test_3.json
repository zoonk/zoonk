      "conclusion": "1) english_title mismatch: \"Derecho Penal Espa√±ol\" was translated as \"Criminal Law\" instead of the more precise \"Spanish Criminal Law\". 2) Limited coverage: Did not include broader or related jurisdictional options suggested by expectations (e.g., \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil Mexicano\", \"Derecho Laboral Mexicano\")."

      "conclusion": "1) Include \"Derecho Penal Mexicano\" and consider other relevant Spanish-language jurisdictions. 2) Replace the generic \"Derecho\" with a jurisdictional alternative such as \"Derecho Mexicano\". 3) Ensure english_title includes the jurisdiction (e.g., \"Mexican Criminal Law\", \"Mexican Law\"). 4) Add a few more concise, single-topic titles within 5 words, all with jurisdiction and correct English translations."
