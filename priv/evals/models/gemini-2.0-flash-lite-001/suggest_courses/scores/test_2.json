The specific targeted topic should appear exactly as a title \"Black Holes\"; instead, the title is \"Buracos Negros\" (Portuguese). This violates both the output language rule and the expectation to include the exact topic in the title. Both titles use Portuguese (\"Buracos Negros\", \"Física\"), compounding the error."
