The instructions require that, except for truly global fields like International Law or Human Rights, all law course titles must include a jurisdiction (here it should be Mexican). This is a core constraint and a significant error.",

      "conclusion": "- Fix the second title to include jurisdiction (e.g., \"Teoría del Derecho Penal Mexicano\").\n- Optionally add more relevant Mexican law suggestions to enrich coverage, such as \"Derecho Procesal Penal Mexicano\", \"Derecho Constitucional Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil Mexicano\", \"Derecho Laboral Mexicano\", or the broader \"Derecho Mexicano\".\n- Ensure every non-global law title always carries the jurisdiction to fully comply with the rules.",
