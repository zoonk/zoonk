      "conclusion": "- The expected title was \"Derecho Penal Mexicano\"; the suggestion uses lowercase \"mexicano\". While correct in Spanish style, it may not exactly match the expectation’s casing.\n- \"Argentinian Criminal Law\" is acceptable, but \"Argentine Criminal Law\" is more standard.\n- Could have optionally included broader/similar Spanish-jurisdiction suggestions (e.g., \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil mexicano\", \"Derecho Laboral mexicano\") as hinted in expectations, though not required.",

      "kind": "potential_improvements",
      "conclusion": "- Add one or two broader/similar Spanish-language jurisdiction options such as \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil mexicano\", or \"Derecho Laboral mexicano\".\n- Consider standardizing english_title to \"Argentine Criminal Law\".\n- Optionally vary icons for visual diversity, though not required.",
