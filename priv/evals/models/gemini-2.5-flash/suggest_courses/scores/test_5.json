The title is \"Preparação para o TOEFL\" instead of simply \"TOEFL\". The english_title is \"TOEFL Test Preparation\" instead of the exam name \"TOEFL\". This also conflicts with the expectation to avoid prep-style titles like \"Preparatório para o TOEFL\", which \"Preparação para o TOEFL\" effectively is."
