The suggestions include 'International Law', all titles are in English, <=5 words, no level/joiner words, no 'course/program' terms, english_title fields match titles, icons have 'tabler-' prefix, and is_language_course is false for all. Jurisdiction rules are respected because all law items are global domains (International Law, Human Rights Law, International Trade Law, International Arbitration).",

    {
      "kind": "minor_errors",
      "conclusion": "Very minor ambiguity: 'International Trade Law' and 'International Arbitration' are treated as global law areas; while reasonable, the instructions only explicitly listed International Law and Human Rights as examples of global courses. This is a negligible issue, as both topics are commonly taught as transnational fields. Additionally, one suggestion ('International Relations') is not a law course; still relevant, but slightly less on-target than a law subfield.",

    {
      "kind": "potential_improvements",
      "conclusion": "- Replace 'International Relations' with a more law-focused global subfield like 'International Humanitarian Law', 'Law of the Sea', or 'Refugee Law' to tighten topical relevance.\n- Optionally clarify global scope by choosing clearly global law subfields to avoid any jurisdiction ambiguity.\n- Maintain current strong compliance on titles, english_title, and is_language_course.",
