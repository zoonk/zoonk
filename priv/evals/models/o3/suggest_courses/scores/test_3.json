Titles are within 5 words, avoid level/joiner words, and contain no joining punctuation. Output language is Spanish, icons have tabler- prefix, english_title translations are accurate, and is_language_course is false for all.",

      "conclusion": "Could broaden the set by adding other relevant Mexican law areas (e.g., “Derecho Mexicano”, “Derecho Civil mexicano”, “Derecho Laboral mexicano”) for wider exploration, though not required. Consider consistent stylistic capitalization across titles if desired for branding consistency.",
