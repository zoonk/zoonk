      "conclusion": "Replace the non-jurisdiction title with a compliant one (e.g., \"Derecho Penal Mexicano\" or another distinct Mexican-law topic like \"Derecho Procesal Penal Mexicano\"). Adjust english_title to \"Mexican Criminal Law\". Optionally add other single-topic Mexican law suggestions (e.g., \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil Mexicano\", \"Derecho Laboral Mexicano\") while keeping titles â‰¤5 words.",
