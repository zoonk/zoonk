      "conclusion": "Some english_title phrasings could be more natural: (1) “Mexican Criminal Procedure” could be “Mexican Criminal Procedure Law.” (2) “Mexican Economic Criminal Law” is understandable but somewhat calqued; alternatives like “Mexican Economic Criminal Law” is acceptable in academia, but “Mexican White-Collar Crime Law” might read more naturally in English. (3) “Theory of Crime in Mexico” could be “Mexican Theory of Crime.” These are stylistic/terminological nuances, not correctness issues.",

      "conclusion": "Optionally add broader or adjacent Mexican law topics the user might find relevant (e.g., “Derecho Mexicano”, “Derecho Civil Mexicano”, “Derecho Laboral Mexicano”), though not required. Slightly refine english_title consistency to either include “Law” where appropriate or use widely accepted field names in English.",
