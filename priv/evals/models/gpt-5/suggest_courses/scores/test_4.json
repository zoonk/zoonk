      "conclusion": "One minor ambiguity: the title 'Refugee Law' could be interpreted as domestic law, which would normally require a jurisdiction when USER_COUNTRY is empty. Given the description references the 1951 Convention, it's clearly international in scope, but the title could more explicitly reflect that (e.g., 'International Refugee Law').",

    {
      "kind": "potential_improvements",
      "conclusion": "Rename 'Refugee Law' to 'International Refugee Law' to clearly signal a global course and avoid any jurisdiction ambiguity. Optionally, include one jurisdiction-specific alternative based on English (e.g., 'US Immigration Law') only if expanding beyond the international law theme is desired, but not required here.",
