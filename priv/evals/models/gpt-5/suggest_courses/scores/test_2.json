The output follows APP_LANGUAGE=English, includes the exact topic \"Black Holes\" as one suggestion, provides only single-topic titles without joiners or levels, keeps titles to <=5 words, avoids words like \"course/program\" in titles, includes english_title for each (matching the English titles), sets is_language_course=false for all, and uses icons with the tabler- prefix.",

Otherwise, this is already very strong.",
