Including more broad canonical courses like \"Programação\" or \"Ciência da Computação\" would better match expectations for a vague intent like \"I want to code\".",

Optionally replace one or two language-specific items with these broader options while keeping the rest as is. Everything else (titles, english_title, icon prefix, is_language_course) is already correct.",
