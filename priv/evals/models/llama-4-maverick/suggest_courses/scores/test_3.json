      "conclusion": "One suggestion targets Spain (\"Derecho Penal Espa√±ol\"), which is less aligned with the user's country Mexico; while not explicitly forbidden, defaults should center on the provided jurisdiction for relevance. Otherwise language, icon prefix, title length, and is_language_course fields are correct for all items.",

      "conclusion": "Replace the generic \"Derecho Penal\" with a jurisdictional alternative (e.g., \"Derecho Procesal Penal Mexicano\", \"Derecho Mexicano\", \"Derecho Civil Mexicano\", \"Derecho Laboral Mexicano\"). Prefer Mexican-focused suggestions over Spanish to better match the user. Keep all law titles with jurisdiction and within 5 words.",
