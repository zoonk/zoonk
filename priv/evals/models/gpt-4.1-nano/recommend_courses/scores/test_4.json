      "conclusion": "1) Only provided the minimum of three course suggestions; additional related fields could increase breadth.\n2) Descriptions for \"Ciências Jurídicas\" and \"Procedimentos Legais\" overlap in content, reducing distinctiveness.\n3) The output is formatted as an Elixir map rather than JSON, which may not match the expected format."
