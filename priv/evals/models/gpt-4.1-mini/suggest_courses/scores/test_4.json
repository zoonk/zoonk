The suggestion correctly uses English, includes the exact topic International Law, respects the global-law exception for jurisdiction, avoids level/joiner words, keeps the title within 5 words, sets is_language_course to false, provides an english_title matching the title, and uses a tabler- prefixed icon.",

      "conclusion": "Could add more relevant global law suggestions (e.g., Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law, International Trade Law, International Criminal Law) to provide broader options, though not required. Could consider a more specific legal-themed icon such as tabler-scale for visual relevance.",
