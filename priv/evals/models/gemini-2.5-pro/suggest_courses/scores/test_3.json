      "conclusion": "None. All titles are in Spanish, <=5 words, single-topic, include appropriate jurisdictions for non-global law topics, and avoid level/joiner words. The required suggestion “Derecho Penal Mexicano” is present. No law title without jurisdiction is included. Icons have the tabler- prefix. is_language_course is false for all."

      "conclusion": "Minor translation nuance: “Argentinian Criminal Law” is acceptable but “Argentine Criminal Law” is more standard. Inclusion of “Criminología” slightly shifts from law with jurisdiction to a related discipline, but it does not violate rules and is generally acceptable."

      "conclusion": "Consider adding Mexico-focused adjacent options suggested by expectations, e.g., “Derecho Mexicano”, “Derecho Civil Mexicano”, or “Derecho Laboral Mexicano”. Optionally expand jurisdictions aligned with Spanish (e.g., Colombia, Peru). Refine english_title to “Argentine Criminal Law”. If desired to stay strictly within law topics, replace “Criminología” with a jurisdictional law subject like “Derecho Procesal Penal Mexicano”. "
