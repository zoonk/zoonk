While relevant, it slightly departs from the law-focused expectation implied by the input and rules.\n- Could have included more English-language jurisdictions (e.g., Canadian Law, Australian Law) given USER_COUNTRY is empty and APP_LANGUAGE is English, though this is optional.",

      "conclusion": "- Replace or complement \"International Relations\" with law-specific global topics such as \"International Criminal Law,\" \"International Humanitarian Law,\" or \"Law of Treaties.\"\n- Optionally add other English-speaking jurisdictions like \"Canadian Law\" or \"Australian Law\" to better satisfy the jurisdiction guidance when USER_COUNTRY is empty.\n- Keep current compliance on title constraints and icon prefixes.",
