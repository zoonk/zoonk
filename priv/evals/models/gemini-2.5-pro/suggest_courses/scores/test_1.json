The output follows APP_LANGUAGE (Portuguese), avoids levels/joiners, uses single-topic titles, includes english_title for each, sets is_language_course=false (not a language-learning case), and maps a vague input to canonical courses. No law or special-topic constraints violated."

      "conclusion": "None. Titles are ≤5 words, look like real courses, contain no words like “course/program,” and icons have the required 'tabler-' prefix. English translations are accurate."
