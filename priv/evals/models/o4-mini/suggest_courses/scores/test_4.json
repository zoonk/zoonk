The suggestions follow all key rules: English output, titles look like real courses, no level words, single-topic titles without joiners, <=5 words, correct inclusion of International Law, proper english_title mirroring titles, and is_language_course is false throughout. Law-specific rules are respected by keeping all courses in global international domains where jurisdiction is not required.",
