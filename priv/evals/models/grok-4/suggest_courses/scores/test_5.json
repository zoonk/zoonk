The response follows the language exam rule with exactly one suggestion titled \"TOEFL\", sets is_language_course=true, includes an english_title matching the title, uses a tabler icon prefix, and provides a one-sentence description in Portuguese. No violations of title constraints (no levels, joiners, or banned words).",

      "conclusion": "Very minor: The description uses Brazilian Portuguese style (\"vocÃª\"), while the user country is Portugal; still acceptable since the requirement is just Portuguese. Optionally, the top-level wrapper format looks like an Elixir-style map rather than strict JSON, but evaluation focuses on core fields and not container format.",
